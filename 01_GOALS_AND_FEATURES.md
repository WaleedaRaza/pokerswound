## üéÆ FEATURE PROCEDURES (DETAILED)

### **REFRESH RECOVERY (CRITICAL FIX)**

**Current State:**
- Backend: Hydration endpoint exists ‚úÖ
- Database: Has all game data ‚úÖ
- Frontend: Calls hydration ‚úÖ
- **Problem:** Hydration queries wrong table ‚ùå

**What Works:**
```
Player refreshes ‚Üí Page loads ‚Üí Calls GET /api/rooms/:roomId/hydrate
```

**What's Broken:**
```sql
-- Hydration queries (line 350-357 in routes/rooms.js):
SELECT FROM games g  -- This table is EMPTY
WHERE g.room_id = $1
-- Returns 0 rows ‚Üí game = null ‚Üí hasGame: false
```

**The Fix:**
```sql
-- Should query:
SELECT FROM game_states  -- This table HAS the data
WHERE room_id = $1
-- Returns the sophisticated_ game with current_state JSONB
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Without refresh recovery:** Unplayable (browser refresh = game lost)
- **With refresh recovery:** Production-ready (accidental F5 doesn't break game)

**Procedure to Fix:**
1. Edit `routes/rooms.js` line 350
2. Change query from `games` table to `game_states` table
3. Extract hand data from `current_state` JSONB field
4. Extract player hole cards from `current_state.players[X].holeCards`
5. Return same response format (frontend already handles it)

**Test:**
1. Start game, deal cards
2. Press F5 mid-hand
3. Should see same cards, same pot, same state
4. Can continue playing

**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** CRITICAL - MVP blocker
