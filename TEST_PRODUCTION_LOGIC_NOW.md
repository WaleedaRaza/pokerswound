- ✅ Detects betting round complete
- ✅ Deals Flop/Turn/River automatically
- ✅ Handles showdown

### **Frontend:**
- ✅ Listens for `action_processed` events

## 🔍 DEBUG CHECKLIST

### **If Actions Don't Work:**

**Check console:**
```
[TIME] 🎮 Action processed { ... }
[TIME] ✅ Action performed { ... }
```

**Check WebSocket:**
```
[TIME] 📡 Broadcast action_processed to room:...
```

**Check turn validation:**
```
If not your turn: "❌ Not your turn"
```

---

### **If Flop Doesn't Deal:**

**Check console:**
```
[TIME] 🃏 Rendering community cards { "cards": [...] }
```

**Check betting round:**
- All players must have acted
- All bets must match current bet

---

### **If Error Occurs:**

**Backend logs (terminal):**
```bash
tail -f /tmp/poker_*.log
# OR check terminal where npm start is running
```

**Frontend console (F12):**
```
Look for:
❌ Action error { ... }
❌ Failed: ...
```

---

## 📊 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### **✅ Success Indicators:**

1. **Turn Rotation:**
   - "Seat 0's turn" → "Seat 1's turn" (after action)

2. **Pot Updates:**
   - Pot increases after each bet
   - Chips decrease correctly

3. **Street Progression:**
   - PREFLOP (2 cards each)
   - FLOP (3 community cards)
   - TURN (4 community cards)
   - RIVER (5 community cards)
   - SHOWDOWN (winner announced)

4. **Action Validation:**
   - Can't act when not your turn
   - Can't raise less than 2x current bet
   - Can't call if not enough chips

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS

```bash
cd /Users/waleedraza/Desktop/PokerGeek

### **Actions Not Processing:**
