# ✅ FIXES APPLIED

## 🐛 Issue 1: CALL Button Always Shows $0

**Problem:** CALL button displayed "CALL $0" regardless of actual bet amount

**Root Cause:** Frontend wasn't fetching game state to calculate correct call amount

**Fix:** Modified `renderMyCards()` to:
1. Fetch game state from `/api/minimal/game/:roomId`
2. Find current player's bet
3. Calculate: `callAmount = currentBet - myBet`
4. Update button text dynamically
5. Wire button to call with correct amount

**Code:** `public/minimal-table.html` line 720-743

**Result:** ✅ CALL button now shows correct amount (e.g., "CALL $10")

## 🐛 Issue 2: Not Using Production HandEvaluator

**Problem:** Showdown was using placeholder logic (split pot evenly)

**Root Cause:** Adapter was using stub implementation, not production `HandEvaluator`

**Fix:** Integrated production `HandEvaluator` into `MinimalBettingAdapter.handleShowdown()`:
1. Import `HandEvaluator` from compiled TypeScript (`dist/core/engine/hand-evaluator`)
2. Import `Card`, `Rank`, `Suit` classes
3. Convert card strings (e.g., "Ah") → Card objects
4. Evaluate each player's hand using `evaluator.evaluateHand(holeCards, communityCards)`
5. Compare hands using `evaluator.compareHands()`
6. Award pot to best hand(s)
7. Fallback to even split if evaluation fails

**Code:** `src/adapters/minimal-engine-bridge.js` lines 298-442

**Result:** ✅ Showdown now uses production poker hand rankings:
- High Card
- Pair
- Two Pair
- Three of a Kind
- Straight
- Flush
- Full House
- Four of a Kind
- Straight Flush
- Royal Flush

## 📖 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **HandEvaluator Integration:**

**Card Format Conversion:**
```javascript
// Sandbox format: "Ah", "Kd", "2c"
// Engine format: Card(Rank.Ace, Suit.Hearts)

parseCard("Ah") → new Card(Rank.Ace, Suit.Hearts)
```

**Hand Evaluation Flow:**
```javascript
1. Get showdown players (not folded)
2. For each player:
   - Convert hole cards (2) + community (5) → Card objects
   - Call evaluator.evaluateHand(hole, community)
   - Get HandRank { ranking, primaryRank, kickers, cards }
3. Sort players by hand strength
4. Find winners (compareHands === 0)
5. Split pot among winners
6. Return winner descriptions
```

**Fallback Safety:**
- Try/catch around hand evaluation
- If error: split pot evenly, log error
- Ensures game never crashes on showdown
