# üéØ TABLE EVOLUTION PLAN
**From Sandbox ‚Üí Production-Grade Poker Table**

---

## üìä CURRENT STATE (Sandbox)

### ‚úÖ What Works:
- **9-seat grid layout** (3x3)
- **Basic seat rendering** with claim/release
- **Game logic** fully functional (dealing, betting, showdown)
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket
- **Refresh-safe** game state hydration
- **Chip management** with DB persistence
- **Hand evaluation** and winner declaration
- **Show/muck** functionality
- **Dealer/SB/BB** position tracking
- **Host controls** panel

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
- Fixed grid layout (not circular/elliptical)
- No zoom lock (doesn't scale properly)
- Seats positioned in rows, not around a table
- No central table felt
- No community card positioning on table
- Missing pot chip visualization
- No player action animations
- Basic seat tiles (not production polish)

---

## üéØ TARGET STATE (Production Table)

### Visual Design:
```
                    [SEAT 0]
        [SEAT 8]              [SEAT 1]
    
    [SEAT 7]     üü¢ TABLE üü¢     [SEAT 2]
    
        [SEAT 6]              [SEAT 3]
                    [SEAT 4/5]
```

### Key Features:
1. **Circular/Elliptical Table**
   - Seats arranged around perimeter
   - Central felt area for community cards
   - Pot displayed in center
   - Professional casino aesthetic

2. **Zoom Lock System**
   - Fixed aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9 or 4:3)
   - Scales proportionally
   - Adds letterboxing when needed
   - Never distorts elements

3. **Enhanced Seat Tiles**
   - Player avatar/emoji
   - Nickname display
   - Chip stack (live updates)
   - Action indicators (fold, raise, all-in)
   - Timer ring for action clock
   - Dealer/SB/BB badges
   - Card display area

4. **Animations**
   - Card dealing
   - Chip movements to pot
   - Winner chip collection
   - Fold card greying
   - Raise/bet amount pop-up

## üõ† IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Layout Foundation** (DO NOT BREAK EXISTING GAME LOGIC)
**Goal:** Create circular layout while keeping all game logic intact

#### Step 1.1: CSS Grid/Flexbox Circular Layout
- [ ] Create container with fixed aspect ratio
- [ ] Position 9 seats around ellipse using CSS transforms
- [ ] Maintain current seat tile HTML structure
- [ ] Test seat rendering (no game logic yet)

#### Step 1.2: Zoom Lock Implementation
- [ ] Add viewport meta tag for scaling
- [ ] Implement aspect ratio container
- [ ] Add letterboxing for mismatched ratios
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes

#### Step 1.3: Central Table Felt
- [ ] Add SVG or CSS oval table background
- [ ] Position community card area in center
- [ ] Add pot display in center
- [ ] Style to match casino aesthetic

**Validation:** Seats render in circle, zoom lock works, game still runs.

---

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Seat Tiles** (IMPROVE UI, NOT GAME LOGIC)
**Goal:** Make seats look professional without changing functionality

#### Step 2.1: Seat Tile Redesign
- [ ] Add avatar/emoji display (already have nickname)
- [ ] Improve chip stack styling
- [ ] Add action indicator area
- [ ] Position card backs properly
- [ ] Style D/SB/BB badges

#### Step 2.2: Action Indicators
- [ ] "FOLD" label on folded seats
- [ ] "ALL-IN" indicator
- [ ] Last action display (e.g., "Raises $50")
- [ ] Highlight current actor

**Validation:** Seats look professional, all existing game features still work.

---

### **Phase 3: Animations** (POLISH, NOT FUNCTIONALITY)
**Goal:** Add visual feedback without changing game state management

#### Step 3.1: Card Dealing Animation
- [ ] Cards fly from deck to seats
- [ ] Community cards flip onto table
- [ ] CSS transitions for smooth movement

#### Step 3.2: Chip Animations
- [ ] Chips move from player to pot on bet
- [ ] Pot chips move to winner on showdown
- [ ] Stack updates with smooth transitions

#### Step 3.3: Action Feedback
- [ ] Fold cards grey out with transition
- [ ] Raise amount pops up above seat
- [ ] Winner seat pulse/glow effect

**Validation:** Animations enhance UX, game state still correct, refresh-safe.

---

### **Phase 4: Responsive Behavior** (ZOOM LOCK FINAL POLISH)
**Goal:** Handle all screen sizes and aspect ratios elegantly

#### Step 4.1: Horizontal Compression
- [ ] Detect narrow viewport
- [ ] Add vertical letterboxing
- [ ] Maintain table proportions

#### Step 4.2: Vertical Compression
- [ ] Detect short viewport
- [ ] Add horizontal letterboxing
- [ ] Maintain table proportions

#### Step 4.3: Mobile Fallback (if needed)
- [ ] Detect mobile viewport
- [ ] Optionally switch to vertical list layout
- [ ] Keep game logic identical

**Validation:** Table works on all screen sizes, never distorts.

## üö® CRITICAL RULES

### DO NOT:
‚ùå Rewrite game logic from scratch  
‚ùå Change database schema  
‚ùå Modify WebSocket event structure  
‚ùå Break refresh-safety  
‚ùå Touch backend game engine  
‚ùå Change seat claim/release logic  
‚ùå Modify hand evaluation  
‚ùå Alter betting round logic  

### DO:
‚úÖ Keep all existing game logic intact  
‚úÖ Only modify HTML/CSS/JS for UI  
‚úÖ Test after each phase  
‚úÖ Validate refresh-safety constantly  
‚úÖ Use CSS transforms for positioning  
‚úÖ Maintain current data flow  
‚úÖ Preserve all existing features

## üìê TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Zoom Lock Implementation:
```css
.table-container {
  --table-aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
  aspect-ratio: var(--table-aspect-ratio);
  max-width: 100vw;
  max-height: 100vh;
  margin: auto;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Circular Seat Positioning:
```javascript
// Calculate seat positions around ellipse
function getSeatPosition(seatIndex, totalSeats) {
  const angle = (2 * Math.PI / totalSeats) * seatIndex - (Math.PI / 2);
  const radiusX = 45; // % of container width
  const radiusY = 40; // % of container height
  const x = 50 + radiusX * Math.cos(angle);
  const y = 50 + radiusY * Math.sin(angle);
  return { x: `${x}%`, y: `${y}%` };
}
```

## üß™ VALIDATION CHECKLIST (After Each Phase)

- [ ] Game starts correctly
- [ ] Cards are dealt to all players
- [ ] Betting rounds progress
- [ ] Pot accumulates correctly
- [ ] Showdown evaluates winner
- [ ] Chips persist to DB
- [ ] Next hand starts correctly
- [ ] **Refresh during hand restores state**
- [ ] All players see same state
- [ ] WebSocket broadcasts work
- [ ] Host controls work
- [ ] Show/muck works
- [ ] Dealer rotation works

## üìÖ ESTIMATED TIMELINE

| Phase | Time | Complexity |
|-------|------|------------|
| Phase 1 (Layout) | 2-3 hours | Medium |
| Phase 2 (Seats) | 1-2 hours | Low |
| Phase 3 (Animations) | 2-3 hours | Medium |
| Phase 4 (Responsive) | 1-2 hours | Low |
| **TOTAL** | **6-10 hours** | **Iterative** |

---

## üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE STEP

**Start Phase 1.1:** Create circular layout container and position seats using CSS transforms, WITHOUT touching any game logic files.

**Files to Modify:**
- `public/minimal-table.html` (HTML structure + CSS)
- `public/minimal-table.html` (JS for seat positioning only)

**Files to NOT Touch:**
- `routes/game-engine-bridge.js` (game logic)
- `game/MinimalBettingAdapter.js` (game engine)
- Database schemas
- WebSocket event handlers
