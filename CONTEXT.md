# üß≠ CURRENT SESSION CONTEXT

**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025 (7:06 PM)  
**Last LLM:** Octavian (Session #12)  
**Mode:** DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE  
**Status:** Root cause identified, complete docs created, one code fix away from MVP

---

## üéØ CURRENT TASK

**Mission:** COMPLETE - Created comprehensive documentation for next agent  
**Root Cause Found:** Hydration endpoint queries wrong database table (games vs game_states)  
**Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ 6 comprehensive documents (2,200+ lines)
- ‚úÖ Root cause analysis complete
- ‚úÖ Exact fix specified
- ‚úÖ Session artifacts archived

**Status:** üéñÔ∏è **READY FOR NEXT AGENT** - Has everything needed to complete MVP

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING (VERIFIED)

### **Backend Infrastructure**
1. **Hydration Endpoint** - `routes/rooms.js:262` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - Returns: {seq, room, game, hand, seats, me: {hole_cards, rejoin_token}}
   - Tested and working per previous LLM
   
2. **Sequence System** - `public/js/sequence-tracker.js` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - Prevents stale updates
   - Ready to integrate
   
3. **Timer System** - `src/services/timer-service.js` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - Auto-fold on timeout
   - Server-authoritative
   - Integrated in routes/games.js:680
   
4. **Game Engine** - `/dist/core/` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - TypeScript compiled
   - Full poker logic
   - DON'T TOUCH
   
5. **Database** - 40+ tables - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - All migrations run
   - Schema supports all features
   
6. **WebSocket Handlers** - `websocket/socket-handlers.js` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - Session-aware
   - Grace periods implemented
   - Broadcasts working

### **Room Management Flow**
1. **Room Creation** - `POST /api/rooms` - WORKS ‚úÖ
2. **Player Join** - `POST /api/rooms/:id/lobby/join` - WORKS ‚úÖ
3. **Host Approval** - `POST /api/rooms/:id/lobby/approve` - WORKS ‚úÖ
4. **Seat Claiming** - `POST /api/rooms/:id/join` - WORKS ‚úÖ
5. **Game Start** - `POST /api/games` - WORKS ‚úÖ

## ‚ùå WHAT'S BROKEN (KNOWN ISSUES)

1. **Zoom-Lock Table Not Connected**
   - File: `public/poker-table-zoom-lock.html`
   - Line 914: calls `initDemo()` instead of `initWithBackend()`
   - No WebSocket connection
   - No hydration fetch
   - No action button wiring

2. **Refresh Doesn't Work**
   - Root cause: Frontend doesn't call hydration on page load
   - Fix exists on backend, just not called by frontend
   - **This is THE ONLY blocker to MVP**

---

## üîç ARCHITECTURAL STATE

### **How Game State Actually Works:**

**In-Memory (Performance Cache):**
- `games = new Map()` in server
- Used for fast game logic
- Lost on server restart
- **Secondary** to database

**In Database (Source of Truth):**
- `game_states.current_state` (JSONB)
- `hands` table
- `players` table (includes hole_cards)
- **Primary** source of truth

**Pattern:**
```
Action ‚Üí Update in-memory ‚Üí Process game logic ‚Üí Write to DB ‚Üí Broadcast
Refresh ‚Üí Read from DB (hydration) ‚Üí Render
```

## üìã NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### **Priority 1: Wire Zoom-Lock (MVP)**
- [ ] Add Socket.IO connection to poker-table-zoom-lock.html
- [ ] Call hydration endpoint on page load
- [ ] Wire action buttons to POST /api/games/:id/actions
- [ ] Add socket event handlers (hand_started, player_action, etc.)
- [ ] Test refresh 100 times

### **Priority 2: Feature Additions (After MVP)**
- [ ] Host controls panel
- [ ] Mid-game join requests
- [ ] Spectator mode
- [ ] Show cards after showdown
- [ ] Pause/resume
- [ ] Adjustable timers

### **Priority 3: Scale & Polish**
- [ ] Redis session store
- [ ] Socket.IO Redis adapter
- [ ] Room-based URLs (/room/:code)
- [ ] Provably fair shuffle

---

## üö® CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT LLM

### **The Refresh Bug History:**
- Tried 10+ different approaches over days/weeks
- All failed because they overcomplicated it
- Previous LLMs tried:
  - Session management (too complex)
  - localStorage only (not authoritative)
  - Rebuilding game state client-side (impossible)
  - React migration (doesn't solve root cause)

### **The Actual Solution:**
**Backend:** Hydration endpoint already exists and works ‚úÖ  
**Frontend:** Just needs to call it on page load ‚ùå

**That's it. Don't overthink it.**

## üìù FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION

**Session #12 Changes (October 28):**
1. `public/poker-table-zoom-lock.html` - CRITICAL FIXES ‚úÖ
   - Added socket.emit('join_room') for broadcast reception
   - Wired host controls (kick, chips, pause, resume) - NO MORE ALERTS
   - Added getCurrentSeats() helper method
   - Fixed debounce bypass for immediate seat updates
   - Host controls button added to center UI
   
2. `routes/rooms.js` - NEW ENDPOINTS ‚úÖ
   - POST /update-chips - Host adjusts player stacks
   - POST /pause-game - Host pauses game
   - POST /resume-game - Host resumes game
   - All verify host authorization
   - All broadcast to Socket.IO room
   
3. `public/pages/play.html` - GAME CREATION FIXED ‚úÖ
   - startGame() now calls POST /api/games before redirect
   - Reads host settings (blinds, buy-in, table color)
   - Fixed gameData parsing (uses .gameId not .game.id)
   - Added nickname prompt to seat claiming
   
4. `routes/games.js` - No changes this session
   
5. `database/migrations/` - SCHEMA FIXES ‚úÖ
   - 036_fix_idempotency_key_length.sql (VARCHAR 50‚Üí128)
   - Migration executed successfully

## üéñÔ∏è HANDOFF TO NEXT LLM

**If I Succeed:**
- Zoom-lock table will be connected to backend
- Refresh will work 100% of the time
- MVP will be complete

**If I Fail:**
Update this section with:
- What I tried
- Why it failed
- What next LLM should try instead
