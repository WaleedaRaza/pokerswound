# üß≠ CURRENT SESSION CONTEXT

**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025  
**Last LLM:** Octavian (Session #11+)  
**Mode:** PLANNER  
**Status:** Initial indexing complete

---

## üéØ CURRENT TASK

**Mission:** Fix refresh bug by wiring zoom-lock table to existing backend  
**Blocker:** Frontend doesn't call hydration endpoint on page load  
**Status:** Backend ready ‚úÖ, Frontend needs wiring ‚ùå

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING (VERIFIED)

### **Backend Infrastructure**
1. **Hydration Endpoint** - `routes/rooms.js:262` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - Returns: {seq, room, game, hand, seats, me: {hole_cards, rejoin_token}}
   - Tested and working per previous LLM
   
2. **Sequence System** - `public/js/sequence-tracker.js` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - Prevents stale updates
   - Ready to integrate
   
3. **Timer System** - `src/services/timer-service.js` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - Auto-fold on timeout
   - Server-authoritative
   - Integrated in routes/games.js:680
   
4. **Game Engine** - `/dist/core/` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - TypeScript compiled
   - Full poker logic
   - DON'T TOUCH
   
5. **Database** - 40+ tables - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - All migrations run
   - Schema supports all features
   
6. **WebSocket Handlers** - `websocket/socket-handlers.js` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
   - Session-aware
   - Grace periods implemented
   - Broadcasts working

### **Room Management Flow**
1. **Room Creation** - `POST /api/rooms` - WORKS ‚úÖ
2. **Player Join** - `POST /api/rooms/:id/lobby/join` - WORKS ‚úÖ
3. **Host Approval** - `POST /api/rooms/:id/lobby/approve` - WORKS ‚úÖ
4. **Seat Claiming** - `POST /api/rooms/:id/join` - WORKS ‚úÖ
5. **Game Start** - `POST /api/games` - WORKS ‚úÖ

## ‚ùå WHAT'S BROKEN (KNOWN ISSUES)

1. **Zoom-Lock Table Not Connected**
   - File: `public/poker-table-zoom-lock.html`
   - Line 914: calls `initDemo()` instead of `initWithBackend()`
   - No WebSocket connection
   - No hydration fetch
   - No action button wiring

2. **Refresh Doesn't Work**
   - Root cause: Frontend doesn't call hydration on page load
   - Fix exists on backend, just not called by frontend
   - **This is THE ONLY blocker to MVP**

## üîç ARCHITECTURAL STATE

### **How Game State Actually Works:**

**In-Memory (Performance Cache):**
- `games = new Map()` in server
- Used for fast game logic
- Lost on server restart
- **Secondary** to database

**In Database (Source of Truth):**
- `game_states.current_state` (JSONB)
- `hands` table
- `players` table (includes hole_cards)
- **Primary** source of truth

**Pattern:**
```
Action ‚Üí Update in-memory ‚Üí Process game logic ‚Üí Write to DB ‚Üí Broadcast
Refresh ‚Üí Read from DB (hydration) ‚Üí Render
```

## üìã NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### **Priority 1: Wire Zoom-Lock (MVP)**
- [ ] Add Socket.IO connection to poker-table-zoom-lock.html
- [ ] Call hydration endpoint on page load
- [ ] Wire action buttons to POST /api/games/:id/actions
- [ ] Add socket event handlers (hand_started, player_action, etc.)
- [ ] Test refresh 100 times

### **Priority 2: Feature Additions (After MVP)**
- [ ] Host controls panel
- [ ] Mid-game join requests
- [ ] Spectator mode
- [ ] Show cards after showdown
- [ ] Pause/resume
- [ ] Adjustable timers

### **Priority 3: Scale & Polish**
- [ ] Redis session store
- [ ] Socket.IO Redis adapter
- [ ] Room-based URLs (/room/:code)
- [ ] Provably fair shuffle

## üö® CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT LLM

### **The Refresh Bug History:**
- Tried 10+ different approaches over days/weeks
- All failed because they overcomplicated it
- Previous LLMs tried:
  - Session management (too complex)
  - localStorage only (not authoritative)
  - Rebuilding game state client-side (impossible)
  - React migration (doesn't solve root cause)

### **The Actual Solution:**
**Backend:** Hydration endpoint already exists and works ‚úÖ  
**Frontend:** Just needs to call it on page load ‚ùå

**That's it. Don't overthink it.**
