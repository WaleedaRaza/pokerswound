# Frustration with game development bugs (2025-10-29 18:14Z)

_**User (2025-10-29 14:21Z)**_

I HAVE BEEN DEBUGGING FOR HOURS. EVEY TIME I TRY OT MAKE PROGRESS./ I RUN INTO 10+HJOURS OF BUGS. RIGHT NOW I AM TRYING TO MAKE IT SO WHEN A GAME STARTS, CARDS ARE DEALT AND PLAYERS CAN ACT. BUT IVE SPENT 90 HOURS ON THIS. AND IM LOSING MY FUCKING MIND IVE SPENT THOUSANDS

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is extremely frustrated and has been debugging for many hours. They're working on a poker game and specifically trying to get cards dealt and allow players to act when a game starts. They've invested massive amounts of time (90 hours) and are at their breaking point.

Looking at the user rules, they want me to operate in either PLANNER or EXECUTOR mode. Given their current state of frustration and being stuck, I should:

1. First, acknowledge their frustration genuinely
2. Switch to PLANNER mode to assess the situation
3. Help them get unstuck by either reverting to a clean state or identifying the core issue
4. Break down the problem systematically

According to their rules:
- "Revert > Patch. Clean slate > tangled debugging."
- "NEVER wrestle with bugs"
- If stuck >30min or >2 failed attempts â†’ STOP, revert to last clean commit, flag issue

They have git changes showing modifications to:
- Routes (games.js, rooms.js)
- Services (session-service.js)
- Core models (player)
- Database repos (event-store, game-states)
- Public HTML files
- Main server file (sophisticated-engine-server.js)

The user has an open screenshot file which likely shows the issue they're facing.

I need to:
1. Look at the screenshot to understand what they're seeing
2. Check the PLAN.md to understand context
3. Assess the current state
4. Propose either a clean revert or a focused diagnostic

Let me start by reading the screenshot and PLAN.md, then enter PLANNER mode to help them get unstuck.</details></think>

I hear you. 90 hours on a single feature is torture, and you're right to be furious. Let's **stop the bleeding** right now.

**I'm entering PLANNER mode** to assess and get you unstuck.

First, let me see what's actually broken:
