HURRY AND COMMIT AND PUSH TO GIT, WE HAVE 2 MINS HURRY ASAP

---

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to urgently commit and push changes to git. They say they have 2 minutes and want me to hurry. 

Looking at the git status:
- Modified files:
  - .cursor/rules/derived-cursor-rules.mdc
  - .specstory/history/2025-10-28_15-27Z-resolve-game-table-issues-and-indexing.md
  - public/pages/play.html
  - routes/games.js
  - routes/rooms.js
  - src/services/timer-service.js

- Untracked files:
  - .specstory/history/2025-10-29_01-28Z-debugging-start-game-button-issue.md

I need to:
1. Add all changes
2. Commit with a message
3. Push to origin

Since they're in a hurry, I should do this quickly. I'll add all files, commit with a descriptive message based on the file changes, and push.

Let me do this in one go with a clear commit message.</details></think>

I'll commit and push everything immediately!
