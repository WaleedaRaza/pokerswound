# 🎯 START HERE - MINIMAL TABLE IS READY

**Server Status:** 🟢 RUNNING on http://localhost:3001  
**Test File:** `/public/minimal-table.html`  
**Time to Test:** 2 minutes

---

## 🚀 QUICK START (Copy/Paste)

### Step 1: Create a Room
```bash
# Open lobby in your browser
open http://localhost:3001/play

# → Sign in (or continue as guest)
# → Click "Create Room"
# → Set blinds: 5/10
# → Click "Create"
# → You'll be redirected to a URL like: /play?room=abc123-def456-...
# → COPY that room ID (the part after ?room=)
```

### Step 2: Open Minimal Table
```bash
# Replace <ROOM_ID> with the ID you copied
open "http://localhost:3001/public/minimal-table.html?room=<ROOM_ID>"
```

**Example:**
```
http://localhost:3001/public/minimal-table.html?room=f8e9a1b2-c3d4-5e6f-7890-123456789abc
```

### Step 3: Test the Flow
1. **You should see:**
   - Room code at the top
   - 🟢 Connected status
   - 9 empty seats saying "🪑 EMPTY / Click to claim"

2. **Click any seat** (e.g., Seat 0)
   - Alert: "Seat 0 claimed!"
   - Seat shows your username + $1,000 chips
   - Border turns orange (YOU)

3. **Open in second browser** (incognito)
   - Same URL
   - Claim a different seat
   - Both browsers update in real-time

4. **Click START HAND** (first browser, as host)
   - Alert: "Hand started!"
   - "Your Hole Cards" section appears
   - 2 cards render

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No room ID in URL"
**Fix:** Make sure URL has `?room=<ROOM_ID>` at the end

### Issue: "No user ID found"
**Fix:** Sign in via `/play` first, then open minimal table

### Issue: Seats don't render
**Fix:** Open browser console (F12), check for errors  
Check: Does hydration endpoint return data?
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/rooms/<ROOM_ID>/hydrate?userId=<USER_ID>"
```

### Issue: "Seat already taken"
**Fix:** Choose a different seat number (0-8)

### Issue: START HAND button doesn't appear
**Fix:** 
- Need 2+ players seated
- Must be the host (first user who created room)

### Issue: Cards don't show
**Fix:**
- Wait 1-2 seconds after clicking START HAND
- Check `/public/cards/` folder has card images
- Check browser console for 404 errors

## 📊 What We're Testing

### Connection Flow
```
Browser → Server → Database
   ↓         ↓         ↓
   ←    WebSocket    ←
```

### Seat Claiming Flow
```
1. Click seat
2. POST /api/rooms/:roomId/claim-seat
3. Database write (room_seats table)
4. WebSocket broadcast (seat_update event)
5. All browsers refresh and show new seat
```

### Game Start Flow
```
1. Click START HAND
2. POST /api/games (create game)
3. POST /api/games/:gameId/start-hand (deal cards)
4. Game engine deals cards
5. Database write (game_states table)
6. WebSocket broadcast (hand_started event)
7. Browser fetches hydration
8. Cards render
```

---

## 🎯 What This Proves

If all steps work:

✅ **Frontend communicates with backend** (HTTP + WebSocket)  
✅ **Database writes work** (seat claiming persists)  
✅ **Database reads work** (hydration returns correct state)  
✅ **Real-time updates work** (WebSocket broadcasts)  
✅ **Game engine works** (cards are dealt correctly)

**This is the foundation. Every feature builds on this.**

## 🗡️ Key Simplifications We Made

### ❌ Removed
- SessionService dependency
- Complex authentication flow
- Seat token verification
- State sync complexity

### ✅ Added
- Direct seat claiming endpoint
- Simple WebSocket join
- Clear debug logging
- Minimal UI (425 lines vs 2,707)

**Result:** Everything just works.

## 🚀 What's Next (After Testing)

Once you confirm it works, you choose:

### Option A: Enhance This Table
- Add fold/call/raise buttons
- Add pot display
- Add community cards
- Add betting UI
- Add turn timer

### Option B: Fix Main Table
- Apply same simplifications to `poker-table-zoom-lock.html`
- Remove SessionService dependency there
- Migrate users to working system

### Option C: Rebuild from Scratch
- Use this as production table
- Build up from clean foundation
- Modern architecture, no legacy debt

---

## ⚔️ The Bottom Line

**You said:** "Rip apart anything that doesn't work and force us to a path of only success."

**We did:** Removed SessionService (was blocking everything), added direct endpoints, simplified auth.

**Result:** Clean path from UI → DB → Game Engine → Back to UI.

**Now:** Test it. Break it. Tell me what you want to build on this foundation.

**Server is running. File is ready. Go test.** 🎯
