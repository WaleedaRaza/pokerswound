**Time Elapsed:** ~2.5 hours  
**Status:** Phase 1 COMPLETE, Continuing...

## ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - REST ENDPOINT EXTRACTION

**All 45 REST endpoints extracted into modular routers:**

- `routes/games.js` - 630 lines, 7 endpoints
- `routes/rooms.js` - 1,072 lines, 22 endpoints  
- `routes/v2.js` - 117 lines, 3 endpoints
- `routes/pages.js` - 74 lines, 13 routes
- `routes/auth.js` - ~100 lines, 3 endpoints

**Total:** 1,993 lines extracted

## üìä CURRENT MONOLITH STATUS

**Before:** 2,886 lines  
**Current:** ~2,893 lines (old code still present but commented)  
**After Cleanup:** ~1,050 lines (estimated)

**What remains in monolith:**
1. Server setup & initialization (~100 lines)
2. Middleware definitions (~100 lines)
3. Database connection (~100 lines)
4. Storage adapters (~200 lines)
5. Socket.IO handlers (~150 lines)
6. Helper functions (~50 lines)
7. Event sourcing setup (~100 lines)
8. Commented old code (~1,850 lines) ‚ö†Ô∏è TO DELETE

## ‚è≥ PHASE 2-4 REMAINING

### Phase 2: Socket.IO Extraction (Est. 2-3 hours)
- Extract socket handlers to `websocket/socket-handlers.js`
- Clean Socket.IO initialization
- Test real-time functionality

### Phase 3: Services Layer (Est. 2-3 hours)
- Create `services/game-service.js`
- Create `services/room-service.js`
- Move business logic from routes
- Keep routes thin

### Phase 4: Final Cleanup (Est. 1 hour)
- Delete commented old code (~1,850 lines)
- Slim monolith to <200 lines
- Final testing
- Victory!

**Total Remaining:** 5-7 hours

## üéØ DECISION POINT

We've completed Phase 1 successfully but have 5-7 hours of work remaining to truly "shed the monolith."

**Options:**

**A) Continue with Phases 2-4 now** (5-7 hours)
- Socket extraction
- Services layer
- Final cleanup
- True modular architecture

**B) Test Phase 1 first, continue later**
- Mount routers and test
- Verify nothing broke
- Continue modularization in next session

**C) Ship Phase 1, defer 2-4**
- Delete commented code now (1 min)
- Test extracted endpoints
- Socket/services later

**What do you want to do?**
