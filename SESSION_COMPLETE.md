## 🐛 Bugs Fixed (7 Critical Issues)

### 1. ✅ Syntax Error
**Problem:** Server won't start (`/* */` comments)  
**Fix:** Changed to `//` comments

### 2. ✅ Auth Schema Mismatch
**Problem:** `column "email" does not exist`  
**Fix:** Removed email from user_profiles queries

### 3. ✅ Lobby Join Schema
**Problem:** `column "user_id" does not exist`  
**Fix:** Changed to `id` (primary key)

### 4. ✅ Missing Socket.IO Broadcasts
**Problem:** Host doesn't see guest join  
**Fix:** Added `player_joined`, `player_approved`, `player_rejected` events

### 5. ✅ Seat Broadcast Failure
**Problem:** `getDb is not a function`  
**Fix:** Fixed parameter order: `broadcastSeats(io, getDb, roomId)`

### 6. ✅ Game Start Failures
**Problem:** `state` column error + null `stateMachine`  
**Fix:** Schema alignment + initialization timing

### 7. ✅ Refresh Breaking Game
**Problem:** "Seat already occupied" on refresh  
**Fix:** Check if hand active + clear table.seats

## ✅ What's Working

### Core Flow (Tested & Verified):
1. ✅ Host creates room
2. ✅ Guest joins lobby (real-time update)
3. ✅ Host approves guest (real-time update)
4. ✅ Both claim seats (real-time updates)
5. ✅ Host starts game
6. ✅ Hand dealt successfully
7. ✅ Cards visible, actions available
8. ✅ Refresh maintains game state

### Features:
- ✅ Authentication (Google + Guest)
- ✅ Room management
- ✅ Lobby system with approval
- ✅ Seat claiming with validation
- ✅ Game start and hand dealing
- ✅ Real-time Socket.IO updates
- ✅ Database persistence
- ✅ Crash recovery (10 games recovered)
- ✅ Refresh handling

## 📁 Architecture

### Before (Monolithic):
```
sophisticated-engine-server.js (2,886 lines)
├── All REST endpoints inline
├── All Socket.IO handlers inline
├── All business logic inline
└── Impossible to navigate/test
```

### After (Modular):
```
sophisticated-engine-server.js (1,046 lines)
├── Core initialization
├── Database setup
└── Router mounting

routes/
├── rooms.js      → Lobby, seats, management
├── games.js      → Game start, hands, actions
├── auth.js       → User sync, auth
├── v2.js         → V2 API endpoints
└── pages.js      → HTML page routes

websocket/
└── socket-handlers.js → Socket.IO events
```

## 🔑 Key Learnings

### 1. **Schema Alignment is Critical**
Always cross-reference database schema before writing SQL. Column name mismatches (`state` vs `current_state`, `user_id` vs `id`, `email` existence) caused multiple bugs.

### 2. **Initialization Order Matters**
Setting `app.locals.stateMachine = stateMachine` before `stateMachine` was initialized caused null reference errors. Always update dependencies after initialization.

### 3. **Socket.IO Broadcasts Required**
Database updates alone aren't enough. Real-time features require explicit `io.to(room).emit(event)` calls for UI updates.

### 4. **Parameter Order Matters**
JavaScript doesn't throw errors for parameter mismatches, causing silent failures. `broadcastSeats(roomId)` ran without error but all params were shifted incorrectly.

### 5. **Refresh Handling Requires State Checks**
Prevent duplicate operations by checking current state (`isHandActive`) before re-executing logic.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Low Priority)

### 1. Event Persistence
**Error:** `null value in column "aggregate_id"`  
**Impact:** Low - Game works, events just don't persist  
**Fix:** Schema alignment for `domain_events`

### 2. Duplicate Keys
**Error:** `duplicate key violates unique constraint`  
**Impact:** Low - In-memory game works  
**Fix:** Better game ID management

### 3. Missing Columns
**Error:** `column "current_game_id" does not exist`  
**Impact:** Low - Room-game linking fails but not critical  
**Fix:** Add column or remove linking
