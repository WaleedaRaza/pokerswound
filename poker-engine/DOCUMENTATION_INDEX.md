## 📝 KEY INSIGHTS FROM DOCUMENTATION

### **1. Root Cause (from ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md):**
> "The engine operates in a SINGLE PHASE (mutate state immediately), but the UI needs MULTIPLE PHASES (show intermediate states during animations)."

---

### **2. Solution (from SCALABLE_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md):**
> "Event sourcing decouples state mutations from UI updates. The engine emits events, handlers control timing, DisplayStateManager provides correct UI state."

---

### **3. Execution (from IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md):**
> "Week 1 is ADDITIVE. Event sourcing runs alongside existing code. If it breaks, we revert. Old flow keeps working."

---

### **4. Effort (from REFACTOR_EFFORT_BREAKDOWN.md):**
> "Full refactor: 54-65 hours. Ship now: 4-6 hours. 12x difference. But refactor enables scaling to 100+ games."

---

### **5. Files (from EVENT_SOURCING_AFFECTED_FILES.md):**
> "Only 2 critical files need modification: game-state-machine.ts (~20 lines) and sophisticated-engine-server.js (~70 lines). Everything else is new files."

---
