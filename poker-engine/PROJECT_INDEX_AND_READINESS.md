## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT

### **Current Architecture:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  sophisticated-engine-server.js │  ← 1663 lines, monolithic
│  (HTTP + WebSocket + Game Logic │
│   + Display + DB + Auth)        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
           │
           ├─→ GameStateMachine (pure poker logic) ✅
           ├─→ DisplayStateManager (display state) ✅
           ├─→ PostgreSQL Database ✅
           └─→ In-Memory Map (games storage) ⚠️
```

### **Scalability Analysis:**

| Concern | Current State | Scale Limit | Solution Needed |
|---------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Concurrent Games** | In-memory Map | ~100 games | Redis/DB for state |
| **Players per Game** | 9 seats | 9 max | ✅ Sufficient |
| **Server Crashes** | Lose game state | All games lost | Event sourcing |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | Single server | 1 instance | Stateless + Redis |
| **Database Connections** | Direct queries | ~100 concurrent | Connection pooling ✅ |
| **WebSocket Scaling** | Single Socket.io | ~1000 connections | Redis adapter |
