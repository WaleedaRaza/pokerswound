# Complete Game Flow Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step testing procedures for all the new features implemented in the complete game flow overhaul.

---

## Test 1: Progressive Card Reveals (All-In Scenario)

### Objective
Verify that when all players go all-in, cards are revealed progressively with 1-second delays.

### Steps
1. Open `http://localhost:3002/poker-test.html`
2. Create a new game (register/login if needed)
3. Have a second player join (open in incognito window)
4. Host approves guest player
5. Both players claim seats
6. Host starts the hand
7. **Player 1: Click "ALL IN"** ($500 bet)
8. **Player 2: Click "CALL"** (or "ALL IN" if showing $498 left)

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Game engine detects all players are all-in
- ✅ **1 second delay** → Flop (3 cards) appears
- ✅ Toast notification: "🃏 FLOP revealed!"
- ✅ **1 second delay** → Turn (4th card) appears
- ✅ Toast notification: "🃏 TURN revealed!"
- ✅ **1 second delay** → River (5th card) appears
- ✅ Toast notification: "🃏 RIVER revealed!"
- ✅ **1 second delay** → Winner announcement
- ✅ Toast: "🏆 [Player Name] wins $1000"

### Server Logs to Check
```
🎬 All-in runout detected: 3 streets to reveal
  🃏 Revealing FLOP: SA, D3, H9
  🃏 Revealing TURN: DQ
  🃏 Revealing RIVER: D6
📡 Broadcasted hand completion to room:... (after animation)
💾 Updating player stacks in database after hand completion...
  ✅ Updated Winner: stack=1000
  ✅ Updated Loser: stack=0
📝 Hand history saved to database
```

---

## Test 2: Stack Persistence Across Hands

### Objective
Verify that winner's stack ($1000) and loser's stack ($0) persist correctly to the database and are used in the next hand.

### Steps
1. After Test 1 completes, check the game state
2. Wait for auto-start (3 seconds) or manually start next hand

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Winner has $1000 displayed
- ✅ Loser has $0 displayed
- ✅ **Winner posts blinds from their $1000 stack**
- ✅ Loser cannot act (eliminated)

### Server Logs to Check
```
🎮 Active players with chips: 1
🏆 GAME OVER! Winner: [Name] with $1000
📡 Broadcasting game_over event
```

---

## Test 3: Tournament Elimination

### Objective
Verify that players with $0 chips are eliminated and game ends when only 1 player remains.

### Steps
1. Continuing from Test 2
2. Host tries to start a new hand

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Server filters out players with `chips_in_play = 0`
- ✅ Only 1 player qualifies to play
- ✅ Server broadcasts `game_over` event
- ✅ Frontend shows: "🏆 [Winner Name] wins the tournament with $1000!"
- ✅ Action buttons replaced with: "🏆 Game Over! Winner Takes All! 🏆"
- ✅ "Start Hand" button disabled and shows "Tournament Complete"

### API Response
```json
{
  "message": "Game over - tournament complete",
  "winner": "PlayerName",
  "stack": 1000
}
```

---

## Test 4: Rebuy System (Cash Game Mode)

### Objective
Verify that players can rebuy chips in cash game mode.

### Prerequisites
1. Set a room to allow rebuys via database:
```sql
UPDATE rooms SET allow_rebuys = true, game_mode = 'cash' WHERE id = '<room_id>';
```

### Steps
1. Create a new game in the room with rebuys enabled
2. Play until a player loses all chips ($0 stack)
3. Losing player navigates to their player panel
4. **TODO: Add rebuy UI button** (not yet implemented in frontend)
5. Click "Rebuy ($500)"

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ POST `/api/rooms/:roomId/rebuy` succeeds
- ✅ Player's `chips_in_play` increases by $500
- ✅ Rebuy logged in `rebuys` table
- ✅ WebSocket broadcasts `player_rebuy` event
- ✅ All players see: "Player bought in for $500"
- ✅ Player can now participate in next hand

### API Test (Manual)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/rooms/<ROOM_ID>/rebuy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 500}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "newStack": 500
}
```

---

## Test 5: Hand History Audit Trail

### Objective
Verify that every hand is logged to the database with complete details.

### Steps
1. Play 3 hands with various outcomes:
   - Hand 1: Both all-in preflop
   - Hand 2: One player folds preflop
   - Hand 3: Normal play to showdown
2. Query hand history API

### API Test
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3002/api/rooms/<ROOM_ID>/history?limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
```

### Expected Response
```json
{
  "hands": [
    {
      "id": 3,
      "game_id": "sophisticated_...",
      "room_id": "...",
      "hand_number": 3,
      "pot_size": 1000,
      "community_cards": ["SA", "D3", "H9", "DQ", "D6"],
      "winners": [{"playerId": "player_...", "amount": 1000, "handRank": 8}],
      "player_actions": [...],
      "final_stacks": {"player_...": 1000, "player_...": 0},
      "created_at": "2025-01-..."
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Database Query (Direct)
```sql
SELECT 
  hand_number,
  pot_size,
  community_cards,
  winners,
  final_stacks,
  created_at
FROM hand_history
WHERE room_id = '<ROOM_ID>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Test 6: Edge Cases

### 6.1: Three Players, Two All-In
**Setup:**
- 3 players: A ($500), B ($500), C ($500)
- Player A: ALL_IN ($500)
- Player B: FOLD
- Player C: CALL ($500)

**Expected:**
- Progressive card reveal (Flop → Turn → River)
- Winner gets $1000
- Player B keeps $500
- Next hand: 3 players (A or C with $1000, loser with $0, B with $500)
- If loser eliminated, 2 players continue

### 6.2: Split Pot
**Setup:**
- Both players have same hand (e.g., Four of a Kind with community cards)

**Expected:**
- Winner determination shows both players
- Pot split evenly: each gets $500
- `hand_history` shows multiple winners
- Both players continue to next hand with $500 each

### 6.3: Player Folds Preflop (No All-In)
**Setup:**
- Player 1: RAISE $20
- Player 2: FOLD

**Expected:**
- NO progressive card reveal (not all-in)
- Immediate hand completion
- Winner gets pot ($23 - blinds + raise)
- Normal `hand_complete` broadcast (no animation)

## Database Verification Queries

### Check Stack Persistence
```sql
SELECT 
  u.username,
  rs.chips_in_play,
  rs.status
FROM room_seats rs
JOIN users u ON rs.user_id = u.id
WHERE rs.room_id = '<ROOM_ID>';
```

### Check Rebuy History
```sql
SELECT 
  u.username,
  r.amount,
  r.created_at
FROM rebuys r
JOIN users u ON r.user_id = u.id
WHERE r.room_id = '<ROOM_ID>'
ORDER BY r.created_at DESC;
```

### Check Hand History
```sql
SELECT 
  hand_number,
  pot_size,
  array_length(community_cards, 1) as num_cards,
  jsonb_array_length(winners) as num_winners,
  created_at
FROM hand_history
WHERE room_id = '<ROOM_ID>'
ORDER BY hand_number DESC;
```

## Performance Metrics

### Server Response Times
- **Progressive reveal**: 1000ms per street (by design)
- **Stack update**: < 50ms per player
- **Hand history insert**: < 100ms
- **Game over detection**: < 50ms

### WebSocket Events
- `street_reveal`: 3 events for preflop all-in (Flop, Turn, River)
- `hand_complete`: 1 event after all reveals
- `player_rebuy`: 1 event per rebuy
- `game_over`: 1 event when tournament ends

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

1. **Frontend Rebuy UI**: Not yet implemented - need to add rebuy button when player has $0 chips
2. **Side Pots**: Current implementation may not handle complex side pot scenarios correctly
3. **Multi-way All-Ins**: Need extensive testing with 3+ players
4. **Animation Cancellation**: If player navigates away during animation, state may desync
5. **Hand History UI**: No frontend display of hand history yet (only API)
