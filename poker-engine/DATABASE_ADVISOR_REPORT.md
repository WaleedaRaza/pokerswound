# Poker Engine Database Analysis Report
**Generated:** January 15, 2024  
**Purpose:** Database scaling and optimization consultation

## Executive Summary

The Poker Engine database is currently in a **development/testing phase** with minimal data but a comprehensive schema designed for scalability. The system supports real-time multiplayer poker games with room management, user authentication, and complete game state tracking.

### Current State
- **28 rooms** created (test data)
- **22 room players** (mix of authenticated and guest users)
- **6 user profiles** (all guest users currently)
- **0 active games** (no games have been started yet)
- **7 hand history records** (from testing)

## Database Architecture Overview

### Core Tables (15 total)
1. **Authentication Layer**
   - `auth.users` (Supabase managed)
   - `user_profiles` (application-specific user data)

2. **Room Management**
   - `rooms` (game lobbies)
   - `room_players` (players in lobby)
   - `room_seats` (seated players)
   - `room_spectators` (observers)

3. **Game Execution**
   - `games` (active game instances)
   - `players` (players in active games)
   - `hands` (individual poker hands)
   - `actions` (player actions: bet, call, fold, etc.)
   - `pots` (pot tracking and distribution)

4. **Audit & Tracking**
   - `hand_history` (complete hand records)
   - `audit_log` (system activity)
   - `chips_transactions` (financial tracking)
   - `chips_pending` (pending transfers)
   - `rejoin_tokens` (reconnection management)

5. **Configuration**
   - `table_stakes` (stakes configuration)
   - `user_sessions` (legacy session management)

### Event Sourcing Tables (3 additional)
- `domain_events` (event store)
- `event_snapshots` (aggregate snapshots)
- `profiles` (user profile events)

## Data Relationships

### Primary Flow
```
User → Room → Game → Hand → Actions/Pots → History
```

### Key Relationships
- **1:Many**: rooms → room_players, room_seats, games
- **1:Many**: games → players, hands
- **1:Many**: hands → actions, pots
- **1:1**: hands → hand_history

### User References
- **Authenticated users**: Referenced via `auth.users.id`
- **Guest users**: Use UUIDs without foreign key constraints
- **Mixed support**: System handles both user types seamlessly

## Current Data Quality

### ✅ Strengths
- No orphaned rooms (all hosts exist in auth.users)
- No duplicate usernames
- No negative chip balances
- Proper foreign key constraints for core relationships

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
- **5 room players** not in auth.users (guest users - expected)
- **4 room seats** not in auth.users (guest users - expected)
- Missing foreign key constraints for user_id references (by design for guests)

## Performance Analysis

### Index Coverage
- **Comprehensive indexing** on all major query patterns
- **Composite indexes** for complex queries
- **Unique constraints** where appropriate
- **Event sourcing indexes** for audit trail

### Query Patterns
- **Hot tables**: rooms, room_players, players, actions
- **Warm tables**: games, hands, user_profiles
- **Cold tables**: hand_history, audit_log, chips_transactions

## Scaling Considerations

### Current Scale (Development)
- **Rooms**: ~100-1,000 active
- **Users**: ~500-5,000 concurrent
- **Games**: ~100-1,000 active
- **Actions**: ~100K-1M per month

### Target Scale (Production)
- **Rooms**: ~10,000-100,000 active
- **Users**: ~50,000-500,000 concurrent
- **Games**: ~10,000-100,000 active
- **Actions**: ~10M-100M per month

### Scaling Strategies Needed

#### 1. Partitioning
- **Time-based partitioning** for `hands`, `actions`, `audit_log`
- **Hash partitioning** for `actions` by `game_id`
- **Range partitioning** for `hand_history` by date

#### 2. Caching
- **Redis** for frequently accessed data:
  - Active game states
  - User profiles
  - Room information
  - Session data

#### 3. Read Replicas
- **Analytics replica** for reporting queries
- **Geographic distribution** for global users
- **Read-only queries** offloaded from primary

#### 4. Sharding
- **User-based sharding** for `user_profiles`, `chips_transactions`
- **Game-based sharding** for `actions`, `hands`
- **Geographic sharding** for `rooms`

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Add foreign key constraints** for user_id references (with proper handling for guests)
2. **Implement soft deletes** for audit trail
3. **Add data validation triggers**
4. **Optimize query patterns** based on actual usage

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. **Implement table partitioning** for high-volume tables
2. **Add composite indexes** for common query patterns
3. **Set up database monitoring** and alerting
4. **Implement data archiving** strategy

### Long-term (Quarter 1)
1. **Set up read replicas** for analytics
2. **Implement sharding** for extreme scale
3. **Add database-level caching**
4. **Optimize for specific cloud provider** (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, etc.)

## Security Considerations

### Current Security
- **Supabase authentication** with OAuth support
- **UUID-based identifiers** for all entities
- **Audit logging** for all changes
- **Input validation** at application level

### Additional Security Needed
- **Row-level security** (RLS) policies
- **Data encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Access control** for different user types
- **Rate limiting** for API endpoints

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track
- **Query performance** (slow queries, deadlocks)
- **Connection pool** utilization
- **Index usage** and effectiveness
- **Data growth** rates by table
- **User activity** patterns

### Alerts Needed
- **High query latency** (>100ms)
- **Connection pool exhaustion**
- **Disk space** warnings
- **Failed authentication** attempts
- **Unusual data patterns**
