- `update_player_statistics()` - Auto-update player stats
- `find_similar_hands()` - Vector similarity search
- `get_gto_solution()` - Retrieve optimal play solutions
- `is_user_blocked()` - Block status checking
- `is_user_banned()` - Ban status checking
- `get_system_setting()` - System configuration access
- `log_admin_action()` - Admin action logging

### **Indexes Created: 50+**
- Performance-optimized indexes for all major query patterns
- Vector similarity search indexes using HNSW algorithm
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Partial indexes for conditional data
