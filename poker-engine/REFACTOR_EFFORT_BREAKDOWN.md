2. **Betting bug** might be fixed (you said it is)
3. **Real feedback** > theoretical architecture
4. **Motivation** sustained by seeing friends play
5. **Refactor later** based on what actually breaks

**Timeline:**
- **Today:** Test betting one final time
- **Tomorrow:** Deploy to Render
- **This Week:** Friends playing
- **Next Month:** Refactor based on feedback

---

## ‚ùì **WHAT DO YOU WANT?**

**A:** Ship now (4-6 hours), refactor later based on feedback ‚≠ê  
**B:** Refactor first (45-55 hours), ship with perfect architecture  
**C:** Build full platform (150-200 hours), ship when comprehensive
