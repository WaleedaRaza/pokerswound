- **Host view**:
  - See all players requesting to join
  - Approve/reject players
  - "Start Game" button (needs 2+ approved players)

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### **When You Create a Room from `/play`:**

1. Modal opens with blinds/max players
2. Click "Create Room"
3. Backend creates room in database
4. Redirects to `/game?room=<room_id>`
5. poker.html detects `?room=` parameter
6. Calls `autoJoinRoomById(roomId)`
7. Fetches room details from `/api/rooms/:roomId`
8. Connects WebSocket
9. Calls `joinLobby()` → **Shows lobby screen**
10. Host sees "Game Lobby" with room code
11. Guests can join and request approval
12. Host approves players
13. Host clicks "Start Game" → Table loads

### **When You Join a Room:**

1. Click "Join Room" on `/play`
2. Enter room code OR click room from list
3. Redirects to `/game?room=<room_id>`
4. Same flow as above, but as **guest**
5. See "Waiting for host approval..." screen
6. Host approves you
7. Lobby updates → "Approved" status
8. When host starts game → Table loads
