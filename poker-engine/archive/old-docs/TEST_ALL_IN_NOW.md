## üß™ TEST PROCEDURE

### STEP 1: Open 2 Browser Windows
1. **Window 1 (Host):** Open http://localhost:3002/poker (regular browser)
2. **Window 2 (Guest):** Open http://localhost:3002/poker (incognito/private)
3. **In BOTH windows:** Press F12 to open Developer Console

### STEP 2: Create & Join Game
1. **Window 1:** Register/Login ‚Üí Create Game
2. **Window 2:** Register/Login ‚Üí Join Game (use invite code)
3. **Window 1:** Approve the guest
4. **Window 1:** Claim Seat 0 ($500)
5. **Window 2:** Claim Seat 1 ($500)

### STEP 3: Start Hand
1. **Window 1 (Host):** Click "Start Game"
2. **Verify both windows show:**
   - Cards dealt
   - Blinds posted (Player 0: $1 SB, Player 1: $2 BB)
   - Action on Player 0 (has button + SB in heads-up)

### STEP 4: TEST ALL-IN

#### Scenario A: Player 0 Goes All-In
1. **Window 1 (Player 0):** Click **ALL_IN** button
2. **Immediately check SERVER LOGS** for:
   ```
   üîç POST-ACTION STATE:
     Current bet: 500  <-- Should be $500
     Players:
       Player 0: { betThisStreet: 500, stack: 0, isAllIn: true }
       Player 1: { betThisStreet: 2, stack: 498, isAllIn: false }
     isBettingComplete (raw from engine): true  <-- Engine says TRUE (wrong!)
   
   üîç ALL-IN EDGE CASE DETECTED:
     All-in players: [Player 0]
     Non-all-in player: Player 1
     Current bet: 500
     Player bet this street: 2
     Needs to act? true  <-- YES! $2 < $500
   
   üîß OVERRIDING: Player 1 must act before street advances
      isBettingComplete changed from TRUE to FALSE  <-- Our fix!
   ```

3. **Check Window 2 (Player 1):**
   - Should see "Your Turn" indicator
   - Should see legal actions request in console
   
4. **Check SERVER LOGS again**:
   ```
   üîç LEGAL ACTIONS REQUEST:
     Player: Player 1
     Current bet: 500
     Player bet this street: 2
     Player stack: 498
     Player isAllIn: false
     Raw actions from engine: [...]
     ‚úÖ Final legal actions returned: ['FOLD', 'CALL', 'ALL_IN']  <-- NO CHECK!
   ```

5. **Check Window 2 buttons:**
   - ‚úÖ Should see: **FOLD** | **CALL $498** | **ALL_IN**
   - ‚ùå Should NOT see: **CHECK**

#### Expected Result:
- ‚úÖ Player 1 sees correct buttons (FOLD, CALL, ALL_IN)
- ‚úÖ No CHECK button
- ‚úÖ Game waits for Player 1 to act
- ‚úÖ Street does NOT advance yet

#### Scenario B: Player 1 Calls the All-In
1. **Window 2 (Player 1):** Click **CALL $498**
2. **Check SERVER LOGS:**
   ```
   üîç POST-ACTION STATE:
     Current bet: 500
     Players:
       Player 0: { betThisStreet: 500, stack: 0, isAllIn: true }
       Player 1: { betThisStreet: 500, stack: 0, isAllIn: true }  <-- Matched!
     isBettingComplete (raw from engine): true
   
   üîç ALL-IN EDGE CASE DETECTED:
     All-in players: [Player 0, Player 1]
     Non-all-in player: (none - length is 0)  <-- No override needed
   
   ‚úÖ Sophisticated betting round complete - advancing street
   ```

3. **Both windows should show:**
   - Flop cards appear
   - Turn card appears
   - River card appears
   - Showdown happens
   - Winner announced
   - Stacks updated

## üêõ ISSUES TO LOOK FOR

### Issue 1: CHECK Button Appears After All-In
**Symptom:** Player 2 sees CHECK button instead of CALL
**Log to check:**
```
‚úÖ Final legal actions returned: [...]
```
**Should contain:** `['FOLD', 'CALL', 'ALL_IN']`  
**Should NOT contain:** `['CHECK']`

### Issue 2: Street Advances Before Player Acts
**Symptom:** Player 2 never gets to act, game jumps to flop
**Log to check:**
```
üîç ALL-IN EDGE CASE DETECTED:
  Needs to act? true
```
**Should see:** `üîß OVERRIDING: Player 1 must act before street advances`

### Issue 3: Duplicate Buttons
**Symptom:** Action buttons appear twice
**Frontend check:** Look for `isUpdatingActions` in browser console
**Should see:** Flag prevents concurrent updates

### Issue 4: Game Ends Immediately
**Symptom:** Game ends without Player 2 acting
**Log to check:** Should NOT see `üèÜ Hand is complete!` until AFTER Player 2 acts
