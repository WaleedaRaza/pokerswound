# ✅ GUEST UI CLEAR FIX - COMPLETE

## 🐛 **THE BUG**

**Symptoms:**
When a new hand started:
- **Host:** Saw blank slate → new cards appeared ✅
- **Guest:** Saw old cards from previous hand → new cards appeared on top ❌

**Result:** Guest's UI was cluttered with previous hand's cards until they took an action.

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE**

**Different code paths for host vs guest:**

**Host (calls `startHand()`):**
```javascript
async function startHand() {
  // Clear UI before starting new hand
  document.getElementById('communityCards').innerHTML = '';
  document.getElementById('myCards').innerHTML = '';
  document.getElementById('actionButtons').style.display = 'none';
  // ... etc
  
  // Then start hand via HTTP POST
  const response = await fetch('/api/engine/next-hand', ...);
}
```

**Guest (receives WebSocket event):**
```javascript
socket.on('hand_started', (data) => {
  // NO UI CLEARING ❌
  
  // Display new game state (on top of old UI)
  document.getElementById('potAmount').textContent = gs.pot;
  // ... etc
});
```

**The issue:** The WebSocket handler didn't clear the UI before displaying the new hand state, so old cards remained visible.

---

## ✅ **THE FIX**

Added UI clearing logic to the **`hand_started` WebSocket handler**:

```javascript
socket.on('hand_started', (data) => {
  debug('🃏 Hand started event', data);
  
  // CRITICAL: Clear UI from previous hand (especially for guests)
  document.getElementById('communityCards').innerHTML = '';
  document.getElementById('myCards').innerHTML = '';
  document.getElementById('actionButtons').style.display = 'none';
  document.getElementById('handStrength').style.display = 'none';
  document.getElementById('myCardsSection').style.display = 'none';
  document.getElementById('startBtn').style.display = 'none';
  
  // Store game state ID
  if (data.gameStateId) {
    gameId = data.gameStateId;
  }
  
  // Display public game state (now on clean slate)
  if (data.gameState) {
    const gs = data.gameState;
    
    document.getElementById('communitySection').style.display = 'block';
    document.getElementById('potAmount').textContent = gs.pot || 0;
    document.getElementById('currentBet').textContent = gs.currentBet || 0;
    
    // ... rest of handler
  }
  
  // Fetch my hole cards (for guests who didn't initiate the hand)
  fetchMyCards();
  
  // Reload to show updated seats/chips
  setTimeout(loadRoom, 500);
});
```

**What's cleared:**
1. ✅ Community cards (innerHTML = '')
2. ✅ Hole cards (innerHTML = '')
3. ✅ Action buttons (display = 'none')
4. ✅ Hand strength display (display = 'none')
5. ✅ My cards section (display = 'none')
6. ✅ Start button (display = 'none')

## 🎯 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **Before Fix:**

**Guest's Experience:**
1. Hand 1 completes → sees "6♠ Q♥" + "A♠ K♦ Q♦ 6♠ 6♣" community cards
2. Countdown: `5s → 4s → 3s → 2s → 1s → STARTING...`
3. Host starts Hand 2
4. **Guest still sees old cards "6♠ Q♥" and "A♠ K♦ Q♦ 6♠ 6♣"** ❌
5. After first action → new cards appear

### **After Fix:**

**Guest's Experience:**
1. Hand 1 completes → sees "6♠ Q♥" + "A♠ K♦ Q♦ 6♠ 6♣" community cards
2. Countdown: `5s → 4s → 3s → 2s → 1s → STARTING...`
3. Host starts Hand 2
4. **Guest sees BLANK SLATE (all cards cleared)** ✅
5. New hole cards appear: "7♥ Q♦"
6. Clean, professional experience

## 🧪 **TEST SCENARIOS**

### **Test 1: Multi-Hand Flow (Guest Perspective)**
1. Join a game as guest
2. Play Hand 1 to completion
3. After winner modal → see countdown
4. When Hand 2 starts:
   - **Expected:** Old cards disappear immediately
   - **Expected:** Blank slate for ~0.5 seconds
   - **Expected:** New cards appear
   - **Expected:** No overlap of old/new cards

### **Test 2: Multi-Hand Flow (Host Perspective)**
1. Start a game as host
2. Play Hand 1 to completion
3. After winner modal → see countdown
4. When Hand 2 auto-starts:
   - **Expected:** Old cards disappear (already working)
   - **Expected:** Blank slate for ~0.5 seconds
   - **Expected:** New cards appear
   - **Expected:** Same experience as before

### **Test 3: Synchronized Experience**
1. Have host and guest side-by-side
2. Play a hand to completion
3. Both see countdown
4. When next hand starts:
   - **Expected:** Both see blank slate at same time
   - **Expected:** Both get new cards at same time
   - **Expected:** Identical visual experience
