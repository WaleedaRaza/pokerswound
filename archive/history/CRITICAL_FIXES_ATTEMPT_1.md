## 🔍 ISSUES IDENTIFIED FROM TERMINAL LOGS

### Error 1: State Machine NULL (Line 948)
```
Start hand error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'processAction')
```

**Root Cause:**
- Line 262: `stateMachine = null`
- Line 722: `app.locals.stateMachine = stateMachine` ← **Sets to null**
- Line 1003: `stateMachine = new GameStateMachine(...)` ← **Initializes later**
- **Missing:** Never updated `app.locals.stateMachine` after init!

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// sophisticated-engine-server.js:1004
stateMachine = new GameStateMachine(Math.random, eventBus);
app.locals.stateMachine = stateMachine; // ⚔️ MIRA: Update app.locals AFTER init

// Also in fallback (line 1038):
app.locals.stateMachine = stateMachine; // ⚔️ MIRA: Update app.locals in fallback too
```

### Error 2: Column "current_game_id" Doesn't Exist (Line 891)
```
error=column "current_game_id" of relation "rooms" does not exist
```

**Root Cause:**
Database doesn't have `current_game_id` column (schema mismatch)

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// routes/games.js:95
// BEFORE: UPDATE rooms SET game_id = $1, current_game_id = $2 WHERE id = $3
// AFTER:  UPDATE rooms SET game_id = $1 WHERE id = $2
```

### Error 3: Seat Already Occupied (Line 953)
```
Start hand error: Error: Seat already occupied
```

**Root Cause:**
When first attempt failed (due to null stateMachine), players were already added to game. Then retry attempted to add them again.

**Fix:**
Once stateMachine null is fixed, this should resolve automatically.

## ✅ CHANGES MADE

**File 1: sophisticated-engine-server.js**
- Line 1004: Added `app.locals.stateMachine = stateMachine;` after initialization
- Line 1038: Added same in fallback path

**File 2: routes/games.js**
- Line 95-96: Removed `current_game_id` reference, only using `game_id`

---

## 🧪 TEST PROCEDURE

1. **Restart server:** `Ctrl+C` then `node sophisticated-engine-server.js`
2. **Check startup logs:** Should see "GameStateMachine initialized"
3. **Create room and join**
4. **Claim 2 seats**
5. **Start hand** - Should work now!

**Expected:**
- ✅ No "Cannot read properties of null" error
- ✅ No "current_game_id" error
- ✅ No "Seat already occupied" error
- ✅ Hand starts successfully

## 🎯 IF THIS WORKS

We're back on track. Refresh recovery should also work now.

## 🎯 IF THIS DOESN'T WORK

We'll dig deeper into:
- Game state persistence conflicts
- Player bridging logic
- Duplicate game IDs from recovery
