# 🚨 REFRESH CRISIS - HANDOFF DOCUMENT

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL - Refresh Breaks Game State**  
**Priority:** P0 - Blocking all testing

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Problem:**
When ANY user refreshes the browser during a game:
1. ❌ They see all seats as "taken" (can't see themselves seated)
2. ❌ "Start Game" button doesn't work (throws errors)
3. ❌ Game state appears lost despite database persistence
4. ❌ Multiple schema errors are being thrown but not addressed

**What SHOULD Happen:**
✅ User refreshes → sees themselves still seated, game continues normally  
✅ No state loss, no UI confusion, seamless experience

**Root Cause:**
The refresh recovery logic is broken. Database has the state, but frontend/backend aren't restoring it correctly.

---

## 🔴 CURRENT ERRORS (Unresolved)

### Error 1: Schema Mismatch - `game_states` Table
```
Get active game error: column "state" does not exist
  at routes\rooms.js:193:20
  hint: Perhaps you meant to reference the column "game_states.status".
```

**Location:** `routes/rooms.js` line 193-194  
**Query:** `SELECT id, state FROM game_states WHERE room_id = $1`  
**Problem:** `game_states` table doesn't have a `state` column  
**Schema Reality:** Table has `current_state` (JSONB) and `status` (VARCHAR)  
**Fix Needed:** Change query to `SELECT id, current_state, status FROM game_states`

---

### Error 2: Null State Machine
```
Start hand error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'processAction')
  at routes\games.js:401:33
```

**Location:** `routes/games.js` line 401  
**Code:** `const result = await app.locals.stateMachine.processAction(...)`  
**Problem:** `app.locals.stateMachine` is `null`  
**Root Cause:** `stateMachine` is set to `app.locals` BEFORE it's initialized

**Timeline:**
```javascript
// sophisticated-engine-server.js

Line 262:  let stateMachine = null;  // Declared as null

Line 722:  app.locals.stateMachine = stateMachine;  // ❌ Set to null!

Line 1003: stateMachine = new GameStateMachine(...);  // ✅ Initialized LATER

// routes/games.js tries to use it:
Line 401:  app.locals.stateMachine.processAction(...)  // ❌ Still null!
```

**Fix Needed:** Move `app.locals.stateMachine = stateMachine;` to AFTER line 1003

---

### Error 3: Duplicate Game State Keys
```
[PERSIST] Failed to persist game to full schema | error=duplicate key value violates unique constraint "game_states_pkey"
```

**Location:** Game creation logic  
**Problem:** Trying to insert the same `gameId` into `game_states` table twice  
**Likely Cause:** Game is being created multiple times for the same room, or recovery logic is conflicting with new game creation

---

### Error 4: Missing Column in Rooms Table
```
[GAME] Error linking game to room | error=column "current_game_id" of relation "rooms" does not exist
```

**Location:** Game creation logic  
**Problem:** Code expects `rooms` table to have a `current_game_id` column  
**Schema Reality:** Check if this column exists in `Schemasnapshot.txt`  
**Fix Needed:** Either add the column or remove the linking logic

---

## 🎯 THE CORE PROBLEM: Refresh Recovery Flow

### Current Broken Flow:
```
1. User refreshes browser
2. Frontend: DOMContentLoaded event fires
3. Frontend: Parses roomId from URL → Makes GET /api/rooms/:roomId/game
4. Backend: Queries game_states table
5. ❌ FAILS: Schema mismatch (column "state" doesn't exist)
6. Frontend: Doesn't receive game state → Shows "Seats Taken" UI
7. User: Sees seats as taken, can't rejoin
```

### What SHOULD Happen:
```
1. User refreshes browser
2. Frontend: DOMContentLoaded event fires
3. Frontend: Parses roomId AND userId from URL/localStorage
4. Backend: Queries BOTH game_states AND room_seats tables
5. Backend: Finds user's seat → Returns seat_index, chips, game_state
6. Frontend: Receives full state → Restores UI (shows user seated, game active)
7. User: Sees themselves seated, game continues
```

---

## 📁 KEY FILES TO INVESTIGATE

### 1. `public/poker.html` (Frontend Refresh Detection)
**Lines:** ~1140-1178 (DOMContentLoaded listener)  
**Current Logic:**
```javascript
// Line ~1140: DOMContentLoaded event
const roomId = /* parse from URL */;
const response = await fetch(`/api/rooms/${roomId}/game`);
// If game exists, show game UI
```

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Doesn't fetch user's seat
- ❌ Doesn't restore user's chips
- ❌ Doesn't check if user is already seated
- ❌ Doesn't distinguish between "game exists" and "I'm in this game"

**Fix Strategy:**
Need a NEW endpoint: `GET /api/rooms/:roomId/my-state?userId=xxx`  
Returns:
```json
{
  "game": { "id": "...", "status": "active" },
  "mySeat": { "seat_index": 0, "chips": 500, "status": "SEATED" },
  "allSeats": [...],
  "myTurn": true/false
}
```

---

### 2. `routes/rooms.js` (Backend Recovery Endpoint)
**Lines:** 186-213 (`GET /:roomId/game`)  
**Current Query:**
```javascript
const result = await db.query(
  'SELECT id, state FROM game_states WHERE room_id = $1 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1',
  [req.params.roomId]
);
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Column `state` doesn't exist (should be `current_state`)
- ❌ Doesn't include user's seat information
- ❌ Doesn't verify user is actually in this game

**Fix Strategy:**
1. Fix the query to use `current_state` instead of `state`
2. Add a JOIN with `room_seats` to get user's seat
3. Return comprehensive state for UI restoration

---

### 3. `sophisticated-engine-server.js` (State Machine Initialization)
**Lines:** 262, 722, 1003  
**Problem:** State machine is assigned to `app.locals` before it's initialized

**Current Code:**
```javascript
Line 262:  let stateMachine = null;
Line 722:  app.locals.stateMachine = stateMachine;  // ❌ null!
Line 1003: stateMachine = new GameStateMachine(...);  // ✅ initialized
```

**Fix:**
```javascript
Line 1003: stateMachine = new GameStateMachine(...);
Line 1004: app.locals.stateMachine = stateMachine;  // ✅ Set AFTER init
```

---

### 4. `routes/games.js` (Start Hand Logic)
**Lines:** 395-420 (`POST /:id/start-hand`)  
**Problem:** Tries to use `app.locals.stateMachine.processAction()` but it's null

**Current Code:**
```javascript
Line 401: const result = await app.locals.stateMachine.processAction(...);
```

**Error:** `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'processAction')`

**Dependencies:**
- Requires `app.locals.stateMachine` to be set (see Issue in #3 above)
- Requires game state to be properly initialized
- Requires players to be correctly bridged to engine

---

## 🛠️ STEP-BY-STEP FIX STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Fix Schema Errors (5 min)
**Goal:** Stop throwing database errors

1. **Fix `routes/rooms.js` line 194:**
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   'SELECT id, state FROM game_states WHERE room_id = $1'
   
   // After:
   'SELECT id, current_state, status FROM game_states WHERE room_id = $1'
   ```

2. **Fix `routes/rooms.js` response (line 207-208):**
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   res.json({ id: gameState.id, state: gameState.state });
   
   // After:
   res.json({ 
     id: gameState.id, 
     state: gameState.current_state,
     status: gameState.status 
   });
   ```

3. **Fix `sophisticated-engine-server.js` line 1003-1004:**
   ```javascript
   // After line 1003 (stateMachine initialization):
   stateMachine = new GameStateMachine(...);
   app.locals.stateMachine = stateMachine;  // ✅ Add this line
   ```

**Verification:** Restart server, check for schema errors → should be ZERO

---

### Phase 2: Implement Proper Refresh Recovery (30 min)
**Goal:** Make refresh transparent to users

#### Step 2.1: Create New Backend Endpoint
**File:** `routes/rooms.js`  
**Add after line 213:**

```javascript
// GET /api/rooms/:roomId/my-state - Get complete state for refresh recovery
router.get('/:roomId/my-state', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { userId } = req.query;
    if (!userId) return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing userId' });
    
    const getDb = req.app.locals.getDb;
    const db = getDb();
    if (!db) return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Database not configured' });
    
    // Get active game
    const gameResult = await db.query(
      'SELECT id, current_state, status FROM game_states WHERE room_id = $1 AND status != \'completed\' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1',
      [req.params.roomId]
    );
    
    // Get user's seat
    const seatResult = await db.query(
      'SELECT seat_index, chips_in_play, status FROM room_seats WHERE room_id = $1 AND user_id = $2 AND left_at IS NULL',
      [req.params.roomId, userId]
    );
    
    // Get all seats
    const allSeatsResult = await db.query(
      'SELECT seat_index, user_id, status, chips_in_play FROM room_seats WHERE room_id = $1 AND left_at IS NULL ORDER BY seat_index ASC',
      [req.params.roomId]
    );
    
    res.json({
      game: gameResult.rowCount > 0 ? {
        id: gameResult.rows[0].id,
        state: gameResult.rows[0].current_state,
        status: gameResult.rows[0].status
      } : null,
      mySeat: seatResult.rowCount > 0 ? seatResult.rows[0] : null,
      allSeats: allSeatsResult.rows,
      isSeated: seatResult.rowCount > 0
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Get my state error:', e);
    res.status(500).json({ error: e.message });
  }
});
```

#### Step 2.2: Update Frontend Recovery Logic
**File:** `public/poker.html`  
**Find:** DOMContentLoaded listener (around line 1140)  
**Replace with:**

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {
  // Get room ID from URL
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const pathParts = window.location.pathname.split('/');
  const roomId = urlParams.get('room') || (pathParts[2] === 'game' && pathParts[3]);
  
  if (!roomId) {
    console.warn('No room ID found, user needs to join a room');
    return;
  }
  
  // Get current user
  const currentUser = await window.authManager.getCurrentUser();
  if (!currentUser || !currentUser.id) {
    console.warn('No user found, redirecting to login');
    // window.location.href = '/';
    return;
  }
  
  console.log('🔄 [REFRESH RECOVERY] Checking state for room:', roomId, 'user:', currentUser.id);
  
  try {
    // Fetch comprehensive state
    const response = await fetch(`/api/rooms/${roomId}/my-state?userId=${currentUser.id}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    console.log('🔄 [REFRESH RECOVERY] State:', data);
    
    if (data.isSeated && data.mySeat) {
      // User is seated - restore their seat
      console.log('✅ [REFRESH RECOVERY] User is seated at index:', data.mySeat.seat_index);
      
      // Restore UI
      window.currentSeat = data.mySeat.seat_index;
      window.currentChips = data.mySeat.chips_in_play;
      
      // Render all seats
      renderSeats(data.allSeats);
      
      // Highlight user's seat
      highlightMySeat(data.mySeat.seat_index);
      
      // If game is active, fetch game state
      if (data.game && data.game.status === 'active') {
        console.log('🎮 [REFRESH RECOVERY] Game is active, fetching full state');
        // Fetch full game state and render table
        await fetchAndRenderGameState(data.game.id);
      } else {
        // Show "waiting for game to start" UI
        showWaitingForGameUI();
      }
    } else {
      // User is not seated - show seat selection
      console.log('📍 [REFRESH RECOVERY] User not seated, showing seat selection');
      renderSeats(data.allSeats);
      showSeatSelectionUI();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ [REFRESH RECOVERY] Failed:', error);
    // Fallback: show seat selection
    showSeatSelectionUI();
  }
});

// Helper functions (add these if they don't exist)
function renderSeats(seats) {
  // Render all seats with proper status
  seats.forEach(seat => {
    const seatElement = document.getElementById(`seat-${seat.seat_index}`);
    if (seatElement) {
      if (seat.user_id) {
        seatElement.classList.add('taken');
        seatElement.textContent = `Seat ${seat.seat_index} (Taken)`;
      } else {
        seatElement.classList.remove('taken');
        seatElement.textContent = `Claim Seat ${seat.seat_index}`;
      }
    }
  });
}

function highlightMySeat(seatIndex) {
  const seatElement = document.getElementById(`seat-${seatIndex}`);
  if (seatElement) {
    seatElement.classList.add('my-seat');
    seatElement.style.border = '3px solid gold';
    seatElement.textContent = 'YOUR SEAT';
  }
}

function showWaitingForGameUI() {
  // Show "Waiting for game to start" message
  console.log('⏳ Waiting for game to start...');
}

function showSeatSelectionUI() {
  // Show seat selection interface
  console.log('💺 Showing seat selection');
}

async function fetchAndRenderGameState(gameId) {
  // Fetch full game state and render poker table
  const response = await fetch(`/api/games/${gameId}`);
  const gameState = await response.json();
  // Render poker table UI
  console.log('🎮 Rendering game state:', gameState);
}
```

### Phase 3: Test Refresh Recovery (10 min)

**Test Scenario 1: Refresh Before Game Starts**
1. Host creates room
2. Guest joins and is approved
3. Both claim seats
4. **Host refreshes** → Should see themselves seated, "Start Game" button
5. **Guest refreshes** → Should see themselves seated, waiting for host

**Expected Result:** ✅ Both users see themselves seated after refresh

**Test Scenario 2: Refresh During Active Game**
1. Host starts game
2. Cards are dealt
3. **Player 1 refreshes** → Should see their cards, current game state, action buttons
4. **Player 2 refreshes** → Should see their cards, current game state

**Expected Result:** ✅ Game continues seamlessly, no one loses their seat

## 🧪 DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

Before implementing fixes, gather this information:

### Database Schema Verification
```sql
-- Run these queries in Supabase SQL editor:

-- 1. Check game_states columns
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'game_states';

-- 2. Check rooms columns
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'rooms';

-- 3. Check room_seats structure
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'room_seats';

-- 4. Check active games for a room
SELECT id, current_state, status, created_at 
FROM game_states 
WHERE room_id = 'YOUR_ROOM_ID_HERE' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- 5. Check seats for a room
SELECT seat_index, user_id, status, chips_in_play, left_at 
FROM room_seats 
WHERE room_id = 'YOUR_ROOM_ID_HERE' 
ORDER BY seat_index ASC;
```

### Frontend State Verification
```javascript
// In browser console:

// 1. Check current user
console.log(window.authManager.getCurrentUser());

// 2. Check room ID
console.log(window.location.pathname, window.location.search);

// 3. Check localStorage
console.log(localStorage);

// 4. Check Socket.IO connection
console.log(socket.connected);

// 5. Check game state
console.log(window.currentGame, window.currentSeat);
```

## 🔑 KEY INSIGHT

**The fundamental issue is NOT the database or the modularization.**

The issue is that:
1. **Backend has the state** (database persistence works)
2. **Frontend loses context** (doesn't know user is seated after refresh)
3. **Recovery logic is broken** (schema errors prevent state restoration)

**Fix the recovery bridge, and everything else will work.**

---

## ⚠️ WARNINGS

1. **DO NOT** try to "work around" the schema errors - FIX THEM
2. **DO NOT** add more complexity before fixing the root cause
3. **DO NOT** assume the problem is unsolvable - it's a simple recovery flow
4. **DO NOT** skip testing after each fix - verify incrementally

---

## 💡 WHY THIS KEEPS FAILING

**Pattern Observed:**
1. User reports issue (e.g., "refresh breaks seats")
2. Assistant tries quick fix (e.g., add Socket.IO broadcast)
3. New error appears (e.g., schema mismatch)
4. Assistant fixes that error
5. Original problem persists
6. **Repeat**

**Root Cause of Failure Pattern:**
We're treating SYMPTOMS, not the DISEASE.

**The Disease:**
Refresh recovery flow is fundamentally broken due to:
- Missing frontend logic to detect "I'm already seated"
- Schema mismatches preventing state retrieval
- Null state machine preventing game actions

**The Cure:**
1. Fix ALL schema errors (no more "column doesn't exist")
2. Implement proper `/my-state` endpoint
3. Update frontend to use comprehensive state restoration
4. Test end-to-end before declaring victory
