## üìä CURRENT STATUS

### ‚úÖ What's Working (Foundation: 65% Complete)
- **Core Poker Engine** - Full Texas Hold'em (PREFLOP ‚Üí RIVER ‚Üí SHOWDOWN)
- **Lobby System** - Room creation, invite codes, player approval
- **Authentication** - Guest users + Google OAuth with database-compatible UUIDs

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE MIGRATION (Critical Path)

### üìñ Deep Dive: See `ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
**‚Üí For complete architectural context, current state analysis, and detailed technical procedures, read the companion guide**

### Why Architecture First Matters
The 90-hour routing bug happened because everything lives in one 2,746-line file (`sophisticated-engine-server.js`). Changes to routing broke authentication. Changes to WebSocket handlers broke room creation. This is unsustainable.

**The Reality:** You have TWO architectures:
1. **Working Monolith** (2,746 lines) - Everything in one file, works but impossible to maintain
2. **Modern TypeScript** (99 files, ~15,000 lines) - CQRS/Event Sourcing/DDD architecture, 90% built but not fully integrated

**The Migration:** Complete the integration of the modern architecture that already exists. Not building from scratch, but finishing what's 90% done.

### Current State (See ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for details)

**What's Already Built and Working:**
- ‚úÖ Core Game Engine (GameStateMachine, BettingEngine, HandEvaluator) - 100% complete
- ‚úÖ CQRS Infrastructure (CommandBus, QueryBus, EventBus) - 90% complete
- ‚úÖ Database Repositories (GameStatesRepository, EventStoreRepository) - 80% complete
- ‚úÖ Dual-Write Pattern (StorageAdapter with feature flags) - 100% complete
- ‚úÖ Event Sourcing (EventBus, EventStore, EventReplayer) - 70% complete
- ‚úÖ Database Schema (game_states, game_events tables with indexes) - 100% complete

**What's NOT Integrated:**
- ‚ùå Routes (still inline in monolith, TypeScript routes excluded from build)
- ‚ùå Controllers (don't exist, logic mixed in routes)
- ‚ùå Services (exist but excluded from TypeScript build)
- ‚ùå WebSocket Handlers (700+ lines inline in monolith)
- ‚ùå Proper Module Boundaries (everything coupled in one file)

**What This Means:** Most of the hard work is DONE. You just need to wire it together and extract the monolith's inline code into the existing structure.

### Phase 1: Production Foundation (Weeks 1-3) ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE

**Goal:** Make server production-ready so features can be built rapidly without breaking everything.

**Critical Understanding:** You're not building new architecture. You're:
1. Securing what exists (rate limiting, validation, auth)
2. Completing the dual-write integration (database persistence)
3. Breaking the monolith into the modules that already exist

#### Week 1: Security & Stability
**Objective:** Prevent abuse, validate all inputs, protect all endpoints

1. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - Install express-rate-limit package
   - Create rate limit middleware (global + per-endpoint)
   - Apply to all API routes
   - Test: Try to spam endpoint, should get 429 errors
   - **Success:** Can't spam server with requests

2. **Complete Input Validation**
   - Audit all API endpoints (list every POST/PUT route)
   - Create Zod schema for each endpoint's body
   - Add validation middleware before request handlers
   - Return clear error messages on invalid input
   - Test: Send malformed data, should get 400 errors
   - **Success:** Server never crashes from bad input

3. **Harden Auth Middleware**
   - Identify all endpoints that need authentication
   - Apply authenticateUser middleware to protected routes
   - Test: Call protected endpoint without token, should get 401
   - **Success:** Can't call protected endpoints without auth

#### Week 2: Link-Based Session Persistence
**Objective:** Refresh page = stay in game, just like pokernow.club

1. **Implement Room URL System**
   - Change routing: `/room/{invite_code}` serves game interface
   - On page load, check URL for invite_code
   - If invite_code present, auto-reconnect to that room
   - Store current room in localStorage as backup
   - **Success:** Refresh page, still in same room/seat

2. **Add Room Lifecycle Management**
   - Rooms persist in database until explicitly ended
   - Add "End Game" button for host
   - Background job: Delete rooms inactive >24 hours
   - Update room.last_active on any activity
   - **Success:** Room survives server restart

3. **Implement Auto-Reconnect Logic**
   - On WebSocket connect, check if user has active room
   - Query database: Find room where user has seat
   - Automatically rejoin that room/seat
   - Restore game state from database
   - **Success:** Server restarts, users auto-rejoin games

#### Week 3: Modularization
**Objective:** Break monolith into modules so features don't affect each other

1. **Create Module Structure**
   - Create directory structure: api/, services/, domain/, infrastructure/
   - Plan which code goes where (domain = game logic, api = routes, etc.)
   - Document module boundaries (what can call what)
   - **Success:** Clear plan for where new code lives

2. **Extract Routes**
   - Move room routes to `api/routes/rooms.routes.ts`
   - Move game routes to `api/routes/games.routes.ts`

   - Update main server to import route modules
   - Test: All endpoints still work
   - **Success:** Routes organized by domain

3. **Extract Services**
   - Create RoomService for room business logic
   - Create GameService for game orchestration
   - Create UserService for user operations
   - Move logic from routes to services
   - Test: All features still work
   - **Success:** Can test services independently

4. **Extract WebSocket Handlers**
   - Move Socket.IO handlers to separate files by domain
   - Create WebSocketService to manage connections
   - Organize by feature (game events, chat events, room events)
   - Test: Real-time updates still work
   - **Success:** WebSocket logic is modular

3. **Add Socket.IO Redis Adapter**
   - Install @socket.io/redis-adapter
   - Configure Socket.IO to use Redis pub/sub
   - Test with 2 servers: Message from server A reaches clients on server B

## üí¨ PHILOSOPHY

### Why Architecture First
The 90-hour routing bug proved that rushing features on poor architecture is expensive. Spend 6 weeks on architecture, save 600 hours on features.

### Why Procedural Steps
Code changes, but process doesn't. This document focuses on WHAT to build and WHY, not HOW (code). Follow the steps, implement with current best practices.

### Why Chess.com Model Works
