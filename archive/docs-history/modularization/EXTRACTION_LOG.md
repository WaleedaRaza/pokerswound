## 🎯 **ZERO FUNCTIONALITY LOSS STRATEGY**

**1. Extract (Current):**
- Copy exact logic from monolith
- Preserve all middleware
- Keep all error handling
- Use app.locals for dependencies

**2. Wire Up (Next):**
- Pass all dependencies via app.locals
- Mount routers at same paths
- Comment out old routes (don't delete yet)

**3. Test (Critical):**
- Test each endpoint
- Verify same responses
- Check console logs match
- If ANY issues → revert immediately

**4. Delete (Final):**
- Only after ALL tests pass
- Delete commented code
- Reduce monolith line count
