# ⚔️ SEAT RESTORATION FIX COMPLETE

**Problem:** After refresh, player sees their seat as "taken" instead of "yours"  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🐛 THE BUG

**What was happening:**
1. Player claims seat 1
2. Player refreshes browser (F5)
3. Recovery system finds seat in database ✅
4. BUT: UI shows seat 1 as "taken" (green) ❌
5. Player thinks someone else is in their seat
6. Player forced to claim a different seat ❌

**Why it happened:**
- `renderSeats()` didn't distinguish between "your seat" vs "someone else's seat"
- All occupied seats looked identical (green)
- No check for `seat.user_id === currentUser.id`

---

## 🗡️ THE FIX

### **1. Visual Distinction**
**Your Seat:**
- 🟡 **Gold border** (3px, #FFD700)
- Gold background (rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.15))
- Label: "YOUR SEAT (1)"
- Footer: "✅ You are seated here"

**Someone Else's Seat:**
- 🟢 **Green border** (2px, #4CAF50)
- Green background (rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.1))
- Label: "Seat 1 (Taken)"
- No footer

### **2. Prevent Double-Claiming**
```javascript
// Before claiming a new seat, check if player already has one
const mySeat = seats.find(s => s.user_id === currentUser.id);
if (mySeat) {
  showNotification(`You're already in seat ${mySeat.seat_index + 1}!`, 'warning');
  return; // Block claim attempt
}
```

### **3. Enhanced Recovery Notification**
```javascript
// Old: "You are in seat 1 with 500 chips" (info)
// New: "✅ Restored: You are in seat 1 with $500 chips" (success)
```

---

## 📋 CODE CHANGES

### **File: `public/pages/play.html`**

**1. Updated `renderSeats()` function:**
```javascript
// Check if this is the current player's seat
const isMyDatabaseSeat = seat.user_id === currentUser?.id;

if (isMyDatabaseSeat) {
  // Gold styling + "YOUR SEAT" label
} else {
  // Green styling + "Taken" label
}
```

**2. Updated `claimSeat()` function:**
```javascript
// Check if player already has a seat
const mySeat = seats.find(s => s.user_id === currentUser.id);
if (mySeat) {
  showNotification(`You're already in seat ${mySeat.seat_index + 1}!`, 'warning');
  return;
}
```

**3. Updated `restorePlayerSeat()` function:**
```javascript
// Better logging for debugging
console.log('🪑 [RECOVERY] Your seat:', {
  seatIndex: mySeat.seat_index,
  chips: mySeat.chips_in_play || mySeat.chips,
  username: mySeat.username
});

// Better notification
showNotification(`✅ Restored: You are in seat ${mySeat.seat_index + 1} with $${chips}`, 'success');
```

## 🧪 TEST PROTOCOL

### **Test 1: Single Player Refresh**
```
1. Sign in
2. Create room
3. Claim seat 1
4. Press F5

✅ EXPECTED:
- Seat 1 has GOLD border
- Label: "YOUR SEAT (1)"
- Footer: "✅ You are seated here"
- Notification: "✅ Restored: You are in seat 1 with $500 chips"

❌ BEFORE FIX:
- Seat 1 had GREEN border
- Label: "Seat 1 (Taken)"
- No indication it was yours
```

### **Test 2: Multi-Player Refresh**
```
1. Player A claims seat 1
2. Player B claims seat 2
3. Player A refreshes (F5)

✅ EXPECTED:
- Player A sees seat 1 as GOLD (yours)
- Player A sees seat 2 as GREEN (taken by B)
- Player A cannot claim seat 2 (already has seat 1)

❌ BEFORE FIX:
- Player A saw both seats as identical green
- Player A could attempt to claim seat 2
```

### **Test 3: Prevent Double-Claim**
```
1. Player claims seat 1
2. Player tries to click "Claim Seat" on seat 3

✅ EXPECTED:
- Warning notification: "You're already in seat 1! You cannot claim another seat."
- Request blocked before hitting server

❌ BEFORE FIX:
- Request would go to server
- Server would reject (but still a waste)
```

## 🚨 ADDITIONAL ISSUE FOUND (NOT FIXED YET)

**Event Persistence Error:**
```
Failed to publish event: null value in column "aggregate_id" of relation "domain_events" violates not-null constraint
```

**Analysis:**
- Event object has `aggregateId` property
- Database expects `aggregate_id` column
- Mapping might be incorrect in `event-store.repo.ts`
- Events are failing to persist but game continues (graceful degradation)

**Impact:**
- Game still works fine ✅
- Event history not saved ❌
- Recovery from crashes may be incomplete ❌

**Solution Needed:**
- Review `EventStoreRepository.append()` mapping
- Ensure `aggregateId` → `aggregate_id` translation
- Add null check before insert

**Priority:** Medium (game works, but feature incomplete)
