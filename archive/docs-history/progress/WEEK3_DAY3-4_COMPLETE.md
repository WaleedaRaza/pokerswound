## INTEGRATION DETAILS

### Room Limit Logic:

// Before creating room:
1. Count user's active rooms
2. If >= 5, reject with error
3. Show count in error message
```

### Room Display Logic:
```javascript
// On page load (if logged in):
1. Fetch GET /api/rooms/my-rooms?userId=X
2. Render hosted rooms (green border)
3. Render joined rooms (blue border)
4. Show warning if at 5-room limit
5. Hide section if no rooms
```

### Close/Abandon Flow:
```javascript
// User clicks Close/Leave:
1. Show confirmation dialog
2. POST to /close or /abandon endpoint
3. Verify permissions (host vs guest)
4. Update database
5. Broadcast socket event
6. Refresh UI
7. Show success message
```
