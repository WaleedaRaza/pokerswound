## üö® **THE DECISION (Critical)**

**Question:** Fix UX features now vs. modularize first?

**Answer:** **MODULARIZE FIRST**

**Reasoning:**
```

- Total: 4 weeks

Option B (Modularize first):
- Critical refresh fix: 4 hours
- Modularization: 1 week  
- Features (clean code): 5 days
- Total: ~2 weeks

OPTION B IS 2X FASTER
```

**Additional Benefits:**
- No 90-hour bugs
- Features take 1 day instead of 1 week
