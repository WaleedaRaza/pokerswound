## üî• **IN PROGRESS**

**Games Router:**
- Extracting 7 complex endpoints (~1500 lines total)
- Each endpoint has sophisticated game engine logic
- Must preserve:
  - GameStateMachine
  - BettingEngine
  - TurnManager
  - Socket.IO broadcasts
  - Event sourcing
  - Dual-write pattern

**This is the beast titan's hardened armor. Will take time to crack.**

## ‚è≥ **REMAINING WORK**

1. **Complete games router** (2-3 hours)
2. **Extract auth router** (30 min)
3. **Wire up routers in main server** (1 hour)
4. **Test all endpoints** (2 hours)
5. **Delete old code from monolith** (30 min)

**Total remaining:** ~6-7 hours

## üéØ **YOUR CONCERN: ZERO FUNCTIONALITY LOSS**

**Strategy working:**
- ‚úÖ Copying exact logic line-by-line
- ‚úÖ Preserving all middleware
- ‚úÖ Keeping all error handling
- ‚úÖ Using app.locals for dependencies
- ‚úÖ Not deleting anything yet (safe rollback)

**When wired up, everything will work exactly as before.**

**I will complete this. Every feature will work. No soldier left behind.**
