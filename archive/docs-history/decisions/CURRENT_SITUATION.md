## 🎯 **THE DECISION**

**Question:** Fix UX now vs. modularize first?

**Answer:** **MODULARIZE FIRST**

**Why:**
1. Every feature added to monolith makes migration harder
2. Modularizing enables 1-day feature development
3. Prevents another 90-hour bug
4. Math: Modularize first is actually FASTER

**Timeline:**
- Week 2 Day 3: Fix critical refresh bug (4 hours)
- Week 2 Days 4-7: Modularize (break monolith)
- Week 3+: Build features (1 day each)

---

## 📋 **NO FUNCTIONALITY MISSED**

All your requirements are accounted for:

**Refresh & State:**
- ✅ Planned (Day 3)

**Timers & Status:**
- ✅ Planned (Week 3 Days 1-4)

**Room Management:**
- ✅ Planned (Week 3 Days 5-7)

**All Other Features:**
- ✅ Planned (Weeks 4-8)

**See ROADMAP_SUMMARY.md for full checklist.**

## ⚔️ **ARCHITECTURAL STRATEGY**

### **Current State:**
```
sophisticated-engine-server.js: 2,746 lines
├─ Everything in one file
├─ Impossible to maintain
└─ Risk of 90-hour bugs
```

### **Target State (After Week 2):**
```
sophisticated-engine-server.js: <500 lines (wiring only)
├─ routes/ (controllers)
├─ services/ (business logic)
├─ domain/ (game engine)
└─ infrastructure/ (database, auth)
```

### **Result:**
- New features take 1 day instead of 1 week
- No side effects
- Easy testing
- No 90-hour bugs
