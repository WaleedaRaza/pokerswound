**Last Session:** Week 1 Complete (100%)  
**Current Status:** ✅ Server running, all tests passing, ready for Week 2  
**Your Mission:** Build the chess.com of poker

---

## 📊 WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW

### ✅ **Week 1: COMPLETE** (100% - 7/7 tests passed)

You just completed an ENTIRE week of work in a single focused session:

```
✅ Day 1: Database Persistence     (Events + game state survive restarts)
✅ Day 2: Rate Limiting            (4 limiters protecting 6 endpoints)
✅ Day 3: Input Validation         (6 Zod schemas on 9 endpoints)
✅ Day 4: Authentication           (JWT middleware on 12 endpoints)
✅ Day 5: TypeScript Build         (Fixed 3 files, zero errors)
✅ Week 1 End: Final Testing       (7/7 integration tests passed)
```

**What This Means:**
- Your server is **production-ready** for the first time
- You can't spam it (rate limiting)
- You can't crash it with bad data (input validation)
- You can't access protected endpoints without auth (JWT)
- Games survive server crashes (database persistence)
- You have a clean TypeScript build (type safety)

## 🏗️ THE BIG PICTURE: Two Parallel Tracks

### Track 1: **Architecture Migration** (Getting to Production)
**Goal:** Transform the 2,746-line monolith into a modular, scalable system

**Where You Are:**
```
Phase 1: Production Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
├─ Week 1: Security & Stability ✅ COMPLETE
├─ Week 2: Session & Scale Prep ⏭️ NEXT UP
└─ Week 3: Modularization       ⏳ Coming

Phase 2: Feature Development (Weeks 4-8) 
└─ After architecture is solid
```

### Track 2: **Feature Roadmap** (Beating the Competition)
**Goal:** Build features that make pokernow.club look like a toy

**Priority Tiers:**
1. **P0 (Blocker):** Full game flow, refresh handling, data persistence

## 🎯 WEEK 2 MISSION: Link-Based Session Recovery

### The Problem You're Solving

**Current Behavior:**
- Player refreshes page → loses connection to game ❌
- Player closes browser → can't rejoin same seat ❌
- Sessions stored in localStorage → won't scale horizontally ❌

**Desired Behavior:**
- Player refreshes page → stays at table, reconnects seamlessly ✅
- Player exits & returns → can rejoin same seat via URL/link ✅
- Sessions externalized → ready for horizontal scaling ✅

### What "Link-Based Session Recovery" Means

**Core Concept:**
Instead of relying on localStorage (client-side), use **URL-based room identifiers** + **server-side session tracking** to let players:

1. **Survive Refreshes** - Reconnect to the SAME socket/game state
2. **Rejoin Games** - Click a link and return to their seat
3. **Scale Horizontally** - Sessions stored in Redis, not in-memory

**Example Flow:**
```
Player joins room → Gets URL: /game/room-abc123?seat=3
Player refreshes   → Server recognizes room-abc123, seat=3
                  → Reconnects player to same game state
Player exits       → URL saved in browser history
Player returns     → Clicks /game/room-abc123?seat=3
                  → Server checks: seat 3 still theirs? Yes!
                  → Rejoins game at same position
```

### Week 2 Sub-Goals

**Day 1: URL-Based Room Tracking**
- Generate unique room URLs (already have invite codes)
- Pass room ID via URL params
- Frontend reads URL, sends room_id in socket connection

**Day 2: Seat Assignment Persistence**
- When player joins, save `user_id → seat_index` in database
- On reconnect, check database for existing seat
- If seat exists, restore player state

**Day 3: Socket Reconnection Logic**
- Handle `disconnect` → `reconnect` events gracefully
- Detect if same user is reconnecting vs new user joining
- Restore socket listeners for reconnected users

**Day 4: Redis Session Store (Prep for Scaling)**
- Install Redis (or use Upstash for hosted)
- Move session data from in-memory Map → Redis
- Use Redis pub/sub for multi-server coordination

**Day 5: Socket.IO Redis Adapter**
- Install `@socket.io/redis-adapter`
- Configure Socket.IO to use Redis for broadcasts
- Test: Two servers → same game → both receive events

**Week 2 End: Integration Testing**
- Test refresh → reconnect → game continues
- Test exit → return → rejoin seat
- Test multi-server setup (optional, can defer)

## 🧠 KEY ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPTS (Week 2 Focus)

### 1. **Link-Based Sessions**
**Problem:** localStorage doesn't work across devices or after clearing cache  
**Solution:** Encode room/seat info in URL, store session server-side  
**Benefit:** Players can bookmark, share, or return to games anytime

### 2. **Horizontal Scaling**
**Problem:** Single server = single point of failure + limited capacity  
**Solution:** Multiple servers share state via Redis  
**Benefit:** Can handle 10,000+ concurrent players

### 3. **Session Externalization**
**Problem:** In-memory sessions (Map) don't survive restarts or scale  
**Solution:** Store sessions in Redis (or Supabase for simplicity)  
**Benefit:** Sessions persist across server restarts & scale horizontally

### 4. **Socket.IO Redis Adapter**
**Problem:** Multiple servers can't coordinate Socket.IO broadcasts  
**Solution:** Redis pub/sub allows all servers to share events  
**Benefit:** Player on Server A can see action from player on Server B

### 5. **Seat Persistence**
**Problem:** How to know which seat a player had?  
**Solution:** `room_seats` table (already exists) stores user_id + seat_index  
**Benefit:** Players rejoin same seat, no double-sits

## 🎮 YOUR CODEBASE RIGHT NOW

### What's Running
```bash
Server: http://localhost:3000 (node process active)
Status: ✅ All systems operational
```

### Key Files
```
sophisticated-engine-server.js  (2,746 lines) - Main server, needs modularization
src/                            (99 TS files) - Modern architecture, partially integrated
dist/                           (Compiled JS)  - Clean build, zero errors
database/migrations/            (31 files)     - Schema evolution
test-*.js                       (5 scripts)    - Test suite (all passing)
```

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL/Supabase)
```sql
-- Core tables (already exist)
rooms                -- Room metadata (name, blinds, invite code)
room_seats           -- Player seat assignments (room_id, user_id, seat_index, chips)
game_states          -- Game snapshots (for persistence)
domain_events        -- Event log (for audit + replay)
user_profiles        -- User data (username, email, stats)

-- What Week 2 needs
sessions (optional)  -- Session tokens, can use Redis instead
```

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
USE_DB_REPOSITORY=true         # ✅ Database persistence active

## 💡 IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### ✅ What You've Overcome
1. **90-Hour Bug** - You spent 90 hours debugging a routing issue. Week 1 prevents this.
2. **No Persistence** - Games used to disappear on restart. Now they're saved.
3. **No Security** - Anyone could spam/crash your server. Now it's fortified.
4. **Type Chaos** - TypeScript files were excluded. Now you have a clean build.

### 🎯 Why Architecture First
**The Temptation:** "Let's just add chat, it's easy!"  
**The Reality:** If you add features to the monolith, you'll create MORE 90-hour bugs.  
**The Strategy:** Finish the migration (Weeks 2-3), THEN add features rapidly (Weeks 4-8).

### 🔥 Why Week 2 Matters
**Link-based sessions** are the foundation for:
- Tournaments (players must rejoin after breaks)
- Ranked play (players must stay in assigned seats)
- Mobile play (app backgrounding must work)
- Spectator mode (observers must reconnect seamlessly)

If you skip Week 2, you'll have to retrofit session handling into every feature later.
