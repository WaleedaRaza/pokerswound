# 🐛 BUG FIXES - Seat Claiming Now Works

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** FIXED - Ready to Re-test

---

## 🚨 BUGS FOUND DURING TESTING

### **Bug #1: Username Column Doesn't Exist**
**Error:**
```
column "username" does not exist
❌ Join room error: column "username" does not exist
```

**Root Cause:**  
- Added code to update `room_seats.username` but that column doesn't exist
- `room_seats` table only has: `seat_index`, `user_id`, `chips_in_play`, `status`
- Username is stored in `user_profiles` table instead

**Fix Applied:**
1. Changed backend to update `user_profiles.username` instead of `room_seats.username`
2. Updated seat broadcast query to JOIN with `user_profiles` to get username
3. Now usernames display properly

**Files Modified:**
- `routes/rooms.js` lines 193-204 (update user_profiles)
- `routes/rooms.js` lines 227-240 (JOIN with user_profiles in query)

### **Bug #2: Idempotency Keys Too Long**
**Error:**
```
Failed to store idempotency: error: value too long for type character varying(50)
length: 98
```

**Root Cause:**  
- Database column: `processed_actions.idempotency_key VARCHAR(50)`
- Actual keys: 98 characters (too long!)
- Format: `approval-{roomId}-{userId}-{timestamp}` = very long

**Fix Applied:**
1. Created migration to increase column size: `VARCHAR(50)` → `VARCHAR(128)`
2. Migration executed successfully
3. Keys now store without errors

**Files Created:**
- `database/migrations/036_fix_idempotency_key_length.sql`

**Migration Run:**
```bash
node run-single-migration.js 036_fix_idempotency_key_length.sql
# ✅ Completed
```

### **Bug #3: Auth Manager Error on Table Page**
**Error:**
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createClient')
    at new AuthManager (auth-manager.js:9:37)
```

**Root Cause:**  
- `poker-table-zoom-lock.html` loads `auth-manager.js`
- But Supabase CDN script wasn't loaded first
- `window.supabase` was undefined when AuthManager tried to use it

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added Supabase CDN script BEFORE auth-manager.js
2. Correct loading order now:
   - Supabase CDN
   - Socket.IO
   - Sequence Tracker
   - Auth Manager

**File Modified:**
- `public/poker-table-zoom-lock.html` line 1809

## 🧪 RE-TEST PROCEDURE

**Try Again:**

### **Browser 1 (Host):**
1. Create room
2. See host controls
3. Wait for guest...

### **Browser 2 (Guest):**
1. Join room
2. Wait for approval...

### **Browser 1 (Host):**
1. Approve guest
2. Both should see seat grid

### **Both Players:**
1. Click "Claim Seat"
2. **Enter nickname** in prompt
3. **Should work now!** ✅ No errors
4. See seat update with your nickname
5. Other player sees your seat instantly

### **Browser 1 (Host):**

2. Should create game and redirect both to table
3. **Table should load** without auth errors ✅

## 📝 TECHNICAL SUMMARY

### **Database Changes:**
```sql
-- Before:
processed_actions.idempotency_key VARCHAR(50)  -- ❌ Too short

-- After:
processed_actions.idempotency_key VARCHAR(128) -- ✅ Fixed
```

### **Backend Changes:**
```javascript
// Before:
UPDATE room_seats SET username = $1  -- ❌ Column doesn't exist

// After:
UPDATE user_profiles SET username = $1  -- ✅ Correct table
```

### **Query Changes:**
```sql
-- Before:
SELECT seat_index, user_id, username FROM room_seats  -- ❌ No username

-- After:
SELECT rs.seat_index, rs.user_id, up.username 
FROM room_seats rs
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON rs.user_id = up.id  -- ✅ JOIN for username
```

### **Script Loading Order:**
```html
<!-- Before: ❌ -->
<script src="/js/auth-manager.js"></script>  <!-- Supabase undefined! -->

<!-- After: ✅ -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
<script src="/js/auth-manager.js"></script>  <!-- Now works! -->
```
