# 🔧 Session #12 Fixes - What Actually Changed

## Changes Made:

### 1. Fixed `.board-area` → `.board-center` ✅
**Problem:** HOST CONTROLS button wasn't rendering because wrong class name  
**File:** `public/poker-table-zoom-lock.html` line 1826  
**Result:** Button will now appear in center of table

### 2. Added Auth Headers to Start Hand ✅
**Problem:** "User identification required" error  
**File:** `public/poker-table-zoom-lock.html` lines 2000-2016  
**Added:** Auth headers from authManager + user_id in body  
**Result:** Start hand should work now

### 3. Fixed Sequence Tracker for seq=0 ✅
**Problem:** "Invalid sequence number: 0" rejected valid sequences  
**File:** `public/js/sequence-tracker.js` lines 74-85  
**Result:** Accepts 0 and string numbers

### 4. Added Debug Logging for Broadcasts ✅
**File:** `public/poker-table-zoom-lock.html` lines 1678-1694  
**Added:** Logs "RAW seat update received" and "PROCESSED by sequence tracker"  
**Result:** Will show EXACTLY where broadcast flow breaks

## What Should Happen After Hard Refresh:

### Test 1: Host Controls Visible
**Expected:** Center of table shows "🛡️ HOST CONTROLS" button  
**If not:** boardArea is still null, something else wrong

### Test 2: Seat Broadcasts
**When guest claims seat, HOST console should show:**
```
🪑 RAW seat update received: {...}
🪑 Seat update PROCESSED by sequence tracker: {...}
🔄 Refreshing seats...
```

**If you see "RAW" but NOT "PROCESSED":** Sequence tracker blocking it  
**If you see NEITHER:** Socket not receiving broadcast (room issue)

### Test 3: Start Hand
**Click START HAND, should NOT error "User identification required"**  
**Should see:** Hand started, cards dealt

## RESTART SERVER + HARD REFRESH BOTH BROWSERS

Then tell me:
1. Do you see HOST CONTROLS button?
2. When guest claims, do you see "RAW seat update received"?
3. Does START HAND work?
