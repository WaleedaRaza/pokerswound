## ❌ WHAT'S BROKEN

### **Real-Time Updates:**
**Problem:** When guest claims seat, host doesn't see it until refresh

**What's supposed to happen:**
1. Guest claims seat
2. Backend broadcasts `seat_update` event
3. Host's socket receives it
4. Host's table auto-refreshes seats
5. Host sees guest's seat appear

**What's actually happening:**
1. Guest claims seat ✅
2. Backend broadcasts ✅ (see terminal: "📡 Broadcasted seat update")
3. Host's socket... ???
4. Nothing happens until manual refresh

**Debugging needed:**
- Is host's socket in the room? (`socket.join('room:...')`)
- Is the broadcast reaching host's browser?
- Is the `seat_update` listener firing?

---

## 🔍 DEBUG CHECKLIST

**Open browser console and check:**

### **After claiming seat:**
```
✅ Seat claimed! 
🔄 Fetching updated seat state...
🌊 Fetching hydration...
✅ Hydration received
🎨 Rendering from hydration...
📊 Hydration data: { seatsCount: 1 (or 2), mySeated: true }
🪑 Showing seat selection on table
```

**If seatsCount doesn't increase**, the database isn't updating or hydration isn't fetching new data.

### **On other player's screen:**
```
🪑 Seat update received on table: { payload: { roomId: '...', seats: [...] }}
🔄 Refreshing seats...
🌊 Fetching hydration...
```

**If you DON'T see "Seat update received"**, the WebSocket broadcast isn't reaching the client.

## 🎯 WHAT TO TEST

### **Test 1: Seat Update Propagation**
1. **Host claims seat** → Check console for "✅ Seat claimed!"
2. **Guest's browser** → Check console for "🪑 Seat update received"
3. If guest sees it: **seat updates work** ✅
4. If guest doesn't: **WebSocket issue** ❌

### **Test 2: Host Controls**
1. **Host browser** → Should see "🛡️ HOST CONTROLS" button
2. Click it → Modal should open with:
   - Felt color options
   - START HAND button
   - Pause/Resume
   - Kick player
   - Chip management
3. Click "🎮 START HAND" → Should start the game

### **Test 3: Both Seated**
1. Both claim seats
2. Check console for "shouldShowStartButton: true" on host
3. Host should see START HAND button in center AND in modal
4. Click either one → Game should start

---

## 🚨 IF STILL NOT WORKING

**Tell me EXACTLY what you see in console:**

1. **After you claim seat:**
   - What's the `seatsCount` in the log?
   - Does it show `mySeated: true`?

2. **On other player's screen:**
   - Do you see "🪑 Seat update received"?
   - Or nothing at all?

3. **For host controls:**
   - Do you see the button?
   - Does clicking it open the modal?
   - Is the START HAND button visible?

**These console logs will tell me EXACTLY where the flow breaks.**
