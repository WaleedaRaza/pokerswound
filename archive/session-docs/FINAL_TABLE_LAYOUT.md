## üìê Seat Positioning Logic

### During Game:
Players are positioned based on their actual seat index, distributed evenly around the table:
- Bottom: Seats 0-1
- Right: Seats 2-4
- Top: Seats 5-7
- Left: Seats 8-9

### For Seat Claiming:
All empty seats show with "Empty Seat" label and "‚ûï" icon. When players join, they can claim any available seat.

**Important:** The layout doesn't change based on player count - seats are always in the same position. This makes it easy to track position throughout the game.
