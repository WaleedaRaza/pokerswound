# ✅ FINAL POLISH COMPLETE

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. **Table Aspect Ratio** ✅
**Before:** 16:9 (too tall)
**After:** 18:9 (wider, more horizontal)
**Result:** Table no longer cuts off HUD, more breathing room

### 2. **HUD Height Adjustment** ✅
**Before:** `clamp(140px, 26cqi, 260px)`
**After:** `clamp(150px, 28cqi, 280px)`
**Result:** No more scroll needed, HUD fully visible

### 3. **Seat Positioning - No Overlaps** ✅
**Repositioned all seats with more spread:**
```
Seat 0: 50%, 86% (was 88%)
Seat 1: 66%, 80% (was 68%, 82%)
Seat 2: 84%, 64% (was 86%, 68%)
Seat 3: 89%, 50% (was 90%, 50%)
Seat 4: 84%, 36% (was 86%, 32%)
Seat 5: 66%, 20% (was 68%, 18%)
Seat 6: 50%, 14% (was 50%, 12%)
Seat 7: 34%, 20% (was 32%, 18%)
Seat 8: 16%, 36% (was 14%, 32%)
Seat 9: 16%, 64% (was 14%, 68%)
```
**Result:** Better distribution, no overlaps

### 4. **Liquid Glass on Player Tiles** ✅
**Added:**
```css
/* Liquid glass effect */
box-shadow: inset 0 0 20px -5px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);

/* With pseudo-element background layer */
.seat-content::before {
  background: rgba(17, 16, 24, 0.95);
}
```
**Result:** Beautiful frosted glass effect matching site design

### 5. **Bigger Cards** ✅
**Before:** `clamp(28px, 7cqi, 72px)`
**After:** `clamp(40px, 9cqi, 90px)`
**Main player:** `clamp(60px, 12cqi, 110px)`
**Result:** Cards much more visible and readable

### 6. **Bigger Pot** ✅
**Before:** Font `clamp(1.1rem, 5cqi, 2.2rem)`
**After:** Font `clamp(1.6rem, 7cqi, 3rem)`
**Padding:** Increased by 50%
**Result:** Pot is very prominent, can't miss it

### 7. **Z-Index Fixes** ✅
Added proper layering:
- `player-info: z-index: 1`
- `player-cards: z-index: 1`
Ensures content renders above glass background
