# üéØ Seat Positioning - Quick Adjustment Guide

## Current Positions (in poker-table-grid.css, line ~95)

```css
.seat[data-seat="0"] { left: 50%; top: 78%; }   /* Main player */
.seat[data-seat="1"] { left: 62%; top: 70%; }  /* Bottom right */
.seat[data-seat="2"] { left: 78%; top: 54%; }  /* Right bottom */
.seat[data-seat="3"] { left: 84%; top: 50%; }  /* Right middle */
.seat[data-seat="4"] { left: 78%; top: 46%; }  /* Right top */
.seat[data-seat="5"] { left: 62%; top: 30%; }  /* Top right */
.seat[data-seat="6"] { left: 50%; top: 22%; }  /* Top center */
.seat[data-seat="7"] { left: 38%; top: 30%; }  /* Top left */
.seat[data-seat="8"] { left: 22%; top: 46%; }  /* Left top */
.seat[data-seat="9"] { left: 22%; top: 54%; }  /* Left bottom */
```

## Current Sizes (in poker-table-grid.css, line ~110)

```css
/* Main player */
.seat-main .seat-content {
  width: clamp(260px, 45cqi, 480px);
}

/* Other players */
.seat-content {
  width: clamp(110px, 20cqi, 240px);
}
```

## üìê HOW TO ADJUST

### To move a seat:
- **Left/Right:** Change the `left: X%` value
  - Smaller % = more left
  - Larger % = more right

- **Up/Down:** Change the `top: Y%` value
  - Smaller % = higher up
  - Larger % = lower down

### To resize tiles:
- **Main player:** Adjust `clamp(260px, 45cqi, 480px)`
  - First number = minimum size
  - Last number = maximum size

- **Other players:** Adjust `clamp(110px, 20cqi, 240px)`

## üéØ WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

### Option A: Tell Me Exact Positions
For each seat that's wrong, tell me:
- **Seat X:** Move left/right by Y%, move up/down by Z%
- **Example:** "Seat 1 needs to be 5% more to the right and 3% higher"

### Option B: Tell Me Your Target Layout
- **Main player:** How wide should the tile be? (currently 260-480px)
- **Other players:** How wide? (currently 110-240px)
- **Spacing:** Should seats be closer or further apart?

### Option C: Let Me Try One More Time
Based on your screenshot, I think the issue is:
1. **Seats are too small** (need to be bigger)
2. **Not spread out enough** (need more space between them)
3. **Main player not big enough** (need even larger)

Should I:
- **Make ALL tiles 20% bigger**?
- **Spread seats further apart** (more towards edges)?
- **Make main player 30% bigger**?

## üöÄ QUICK FIX OPTION

If you want, I can create a **live adjustment tool** in the browser console where you can:
1. Click a seat
2. Use arrow keys to move it
3. See the CSS output
4. Copy/paste the correct positions

Would that help?
