- **Aspect ratio** constraints (16:9)
- **clamp() for all sizing** (no magic numbers)
- **Container queries** (cqi units)
- **Works at ALL zoom levels** (33%, 100%, 150%)

### 2. **Seat Positioning** ✅
**10 seats around rectangular table:**
- **Seat 0 (Main Player):** Bottom center (50%, 88%), MUCH larger
- **Seat 1:** Bottom right (68%, 82%)
- **Seat 2:** Right bottom (86%, 68%)

**Well-spaced, no overlapping!**

### 5. **HUD Overlay** ✅
