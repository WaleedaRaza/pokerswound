## üé® Visual Impact

### Before:
- ‚ùå Seats cramped and overlapping
- ‚ùå Table felt small on large screens
- ‚ùå Poor use of available space
- ‚ùå Awkward on mobile

### After:
- ‚úÖ Generous spacing between seats
- ‚úÖ Table fills screen appropriately
- ‚úÖ Proportional scaling at all sizes
- ‚úÖ Vertical growth when compressed
- ‚úÖ No overlapping elements
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance

## üì± Responsive Strategy

1. **Desktop (1600px+)**: Grow everything larger
2. **Standard (1400px)**: Maintain proportions
3. **Tablet (1024px)**: Allow vertical growth
4. **Mobile (768px)**: Prioritize vertical space
5. **Small (480px)**: Compact but playable

## üîß Technical Details

### CSS Changes:
- `.poker-table-wrapper`: Increased max/min dimensions
- `.seat[data-position]`: Repositioned all 10 seats
- `.seat-container`: Added margin for spacing
- `.table-surface`: Larger border radius & shadows
- `.game-area`: Reduced padding, added overflow
- Added 5 responsive breakpoints with intelligent scaling

### Key Principles:
1. **Proportional scaling** on resize
2. **Vertical growth** when width constrained
3. **No overlap** at any size
4. **Minimum usable sizes** enforced
5. **Maximum comfort sizes** on large screens

## ‚úÖ Testing Recommendations

Try these viewport sizes:
- 1920x1080 (large desktop)
- 1440x900 (laptop)
- 1024x768 (tablet landscape)
- 768x1024 (tablet portrait)
- 375x667 (mobile)

Verify:
- [ ] No overlapping seats
- [ ] Proper spacing at all sizes
- [ ] Cards are readable
- [ ] Action panel doesn't cover table
- [ ] Vertical scrolling works if needed
