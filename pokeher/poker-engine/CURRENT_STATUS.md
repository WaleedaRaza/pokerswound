## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test the Current Flow

1. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   cd pokeher/poker-engine
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test room creation**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/play`
   - Sign in (Google or Guest)
   - Click "Create Room"
   - Set blinds (e.g., 10/20)
   - Click "Create"
   - **Expected:** Lobby appears with room code

3. **Test player joining**
   - Open incognito window
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/play`
   - Sign in as different user
   - Enter room code
   - Click "Join"
   - **Expected:** Player appears in host's lobby

4. **Test approval**
   - As host, click "Approve" on player
   - **Expected:** Player marked as approved

5. **Test game start**
   - As host, click "Start Game"
   - **Expected:** 
     - Redirects to `/game?room=X&gameId=Y`
     - Poker table loads immediately
     - NO landing page shown
     - NO second room creation required
     - Working poker table with seats, cards, actions

6. **Verify guest redirect**
   - Guest should also be redirected to `/game`
   - Guest should see same poker table
   - Both players ready to play

### What Should NOT Happen
- ❌ Landing page with "Create Room" or "Join Room" buttons
- ❌ Second room creation screen
- ❌ Broken stub table on `/play`
- ❌ Redirect loops
- ❌ Recovery redirect (disabled for now)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow)
1. **Test the flow** - Verify everything works as described above
2. **Report any issues** - If anything breaks, document it

### This Week
1. **Enable database persistence**
   ```bash
   # Edit test.env
   USE_DB_REPOSITORY=true
   USE_EVENT_PERSISTENCE=true
   
   # Restart server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/migrations/add-games-table.sql
   psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/migrations/add-game-states-table.sql
   ```

3. **Test persistence**
   - Create game
   - Restart server
   - Verify game state persists in database

4. **Monitor logs**
   - Watch for `[MIGRATION]` logs
   - Check database for game records
   - Verify no errors

### Next Week
1. Add input validation (Zod)
2. Add auth middleware
3. Add rate limiting
4. Add error handling
