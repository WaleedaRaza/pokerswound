# üîç REFRESH ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** üö® **CRITICAL - NEEDS STRATEGIC FIX**

---

## üéØ THE REAL PROBLEM

### What User Reports:
> "When a refresh is detected, players leave seats. Seats show as taken but users can't interact. We're going in circles."

### What I Was Fixing (WRONG APPROACH):
- ‚ùå Preventing duplicate start-hand calls (symptom)
- ‚ùå Clearing seat data structures (symptom)
- ‚ùå Checking if hand is active (symptom)

### The ACTUAL Root Cause:
**The frontend loses ALL state on refresh and doesn't restore it from the backend.**

---

## üî¨ DETAILED TRACE OF THE PROBLEM

### What Happens on Refresh (Step by Step):

1. **User refreshes page** (`F5` or `Ctrl+R`)
   
2. **Frontend JavaScript reloads:**
   - ‚ùå `currentUser` = lost
   - ‚ùå `room` = lost
   - ‚ùå `currentGame` = lost
   - ‚ùå `seats` array = lost
   - ‚ùå **Which seat I'm in** = **LOST**
   - ‚ùå Current hand state = lost

3. **`DOMContentLoaded` fires:**
   - Calls `autoJoinRoomById(roomId)` (parsed from URL)
   - Re-fetches room data ‚úÖ
   - Re-fetches game data ‚úÖ
   - Calls `loadSeats()` ‚úÖ

4. **`loadSeats()` fetches seats:**
   ```javascript
   const res = await fetch(`/api/rooms/${roomId}/seats`);
   seats = data.seats; // Shows ALL seats, but...
   ```
   - ‚úÖ Backend returns correct data (all seats, including which are occupied)
   - ‚ùå **Frontend doesn't identify which seat belongs to currentUser**
   - ‚ùå Frontend renders all seats as "Taken" with no distinction

5. **User sees:**
   - "Seat 0: Taken" (but this is MY seat!)
   - "Seat 1: Taken"
   - No way to interact
   - "Start Game" button might appear (shouldn't)

6. **If user clicks "Start Game":**
   - Frontend calls `/api/games/:id/start-hand`
   - Backend tries to re-add players who are already in seats
   - Error: "Seat already occupied"
   - Backend now blocks with 409 (but damage is done)

---

## üéØ THE ROOT CAUSE (Summarized)

**Frontend doesn't restore user's seat ownership after refresh.**

### What's Missing:
1. ‚ùå Frontend doesn't fetch "which seat is mine?"
2. ‚ùå Frontend doesn't highlight "YOUR SEAT" after refresh
3. ‚ùå Frontend doesn't restore game state (cards, pot, actions)
4. ‚ùå Frontend doesn't disable "Start Game" if hand is active

### What Backend Has (Correctly):
1. ‚úÖ `room_seats` table knows which user is in which seat
2. ‚úÖ `game_states` table knows if hand is active
3. ‚úÖ Game state in memory has current hand data

**The disconnect:** Frontend and backend aren't synchronized after refresh.

---

## üìä COMPARISON: Before Refresh vs After Refresh

### BEFORE REFRESH (Working):
```javascript
// Frontend State:
currentUser = { id: "abc123", username: "Player1" }
room = { id: "room-xyz", ... }
currentGame = { gameId: "game-123" }
seats = [
  { seat_index: 0, user_id: "abc123", status: "SEATED" }, // MY SEAT
  { seat_index: 1, user_id: "def456", status: "SEATED" }
]
mySeat = seats.find(s => s.user_id === currentUser.id) // ‚úÖ Found!

// UI Shows:
- Seat 0: "YOUR SEAT" (gold border, interactable)
- Seat 1: "Player2" (taken, not interactable)
```

### AFTER REFRESH (Broken):
```javascript
// Frontend State:
currentUser = null ‚Üí await checkAuthSession() ‚Üí { id: "abc123", ... } ‚úÖ
room = null ‚Üí await fetch(`/rooms/${roomId}`) ‚Üí { id: "room-xyz", ... } ‚úÖ
currentGame = null ‚Üí await fetch(`/games?roomId=...`) ‚Üí { gameId: "game-123" } ‚úÖ
seats = [] ‚Üí await fetch(`/rooms/${roomId}/seats`) ‚Üí [
  { seat_index: 0, user_id: "abc123", status: "SEATED" },
  { seat_index: 1, user_id: "def456", status: "SEATED" }
] ‚úÖ
mySeat = ??? // ‚ùå NEVER CALCULATED!

// UI Shows:
- Seat 0: "Taken" (no indication this is ME)
- Seat 1: "Taken"
// User is confused and clicks buttons they shouldn't
```

## üîß THE STRATEGIC FIX (Step by Step)

### Fix 1: Restore User's Seat After Refresh
**Location:** `public/poker.html` - `loadSeats()` function

**Current Code (Simplified):**
```javascript
async function loadSeats() {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/rooms/${roomId}/seats`);
  seats = data.seats;
  renderSeatGrid(); // Just renders all seats
}
```

**Fixed Code:**
```javascript
async function loadSeats() {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/rooms/${roomId}/seats`);
  seats = data.seats;
  
  // ‚úÖ IDENTIFY MY SEAT
  if (currentUser && seats.length > 0) {
    const mySeat = seats.find(s => s.user_id === currentUser.id && s.status === 'SEATED');
    if (mySeat) {
      console.log(`‚úÖ [REFRESH] Restored my seat: ${mySeat.seat_index}`);
      window.mySeatIndex = mySeat.seat_index; // Save for UI
    }
  }
  
  renderSeatGrid();
}
```

---

### Fix 2: Update `renderSeatGrid()` to Highlight User's Seat
**Location:** `public/poker.html` - `renderSeatGrid()` function

**Add Logic:**
```javascript
function renderSeatGrid() {
  seats.forEach(seat => {
    const seatElement = document.getElementById(`seat-${seat.seat_index}`);
    
    // ‚úÖ Check if this is MY seat
    const isMySeat = (currentUser && seat.user_id === currentUser.id);
    
    if (isMySeat) {
      seatElement.classList.add('my-seat'); // Gold border
      seatElement.innerHTML = `
        <div class="seat-label">YOUR SEAT</div>
        <div class="seat-player">${seat.username || currentUser.username}</div>
        <div class="seat-chips">$${seat.chips_in_play}</div>
      `;
    } else if (seat.status === 'SEATED') {
      seatElement.classList.add('taken');
      seatElement.innerHTML = `
        <div class="seat-label">Seat ${seat.seat_index} (Taken)</div>
        <div class="seat-player">${seat.username || 'Player'}</div>
      `;
    } else {
      seatElement.innerHTML = `
        <button onclick="claimSeat(${seat.seat_index})">Claim Seat ${seat.seat_index}</button>
      `;
    }
  });
}
```

---

### Fix 3: Restore Game State After Refresh
**Location:** `public/poker.html` - `autoJoinRoomById()` function

**Add After Loading Seats:**
```javascript
async function autoJoinRoomById(roomId) {
  // ... existing code to load room, game, seats ...
  
  await loadSeats(); // ‚úÖ This now identifies my seat
  
  // ‚úÖ CHECK IF HAND IS ACTIVE
  if (currentGame && currentGame.gameId) {
    const gameStateRes = await fetch(`/api/games/${currentGame.gameId}`);
    if (gameStateRes.ok) {
      const gameState = await gameStateRes.json();
      
      if (gameState.handState && gameState.handState.isHandActive) {
        console.log('‚úÖ [REFRESH] Hand is active, restoring game state');
        
        // Restore cards, pot, community cards, etc.
        renderGameState(gameState);
        
        // Hide "Start Hand" button
        const startBtn = document.getElementById('startHandBtn');
        if (startBtn) startBtn.style.display = 'none';
        
      } else {
        console.log('‚ÑπÔ∏è [REFRESH] No active hand, showing Start Hand button');
        // Show "Start Hand" button if enough players
        updateStartHandButton();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Fix 4: Add `renderGameState()` Function
**Location:** `public/poker.html` - New function

**Purpose:** Display current game state (cards, pot, actions) after refresh

```javascript
function renderGameState(gameState) {
  // Display community cards
  if (gameState.communityCards && gameState.communityCards.length > 0) {
    displayCommunityCards(gameState.communityCards);
  }
  
  // Display pot
  if (gameState.pot) {
    document.getElementById('potAmount').textContent = `$${gameState.pot}`;
  }
  
  // Display my hole cards (if I'm in the hand)
  if (currentUser && gameState.players) {
    const myPlayer = gameState.players.find(p => p.userId === currentUser.id);
    if (myPlayer && myPlayer.holeCards) {
      displayMyCards(myPlayer.holeCards);
    }
  }
  
  // Display whose turn it is
  if (gameState.currentPlayer) {
    displayCurrentTurn(gameState.currentPlayer);
  }
  
  // Display legal actions (if it's my turn)
  if (gameState.currentPlayer === currentUser.id) {
    displayLegalActions(gameState.legalActions);
  }
  
  console.log('‚úÖ [REFRESH] Game state restored');
}
```

## üîß BACKEND FIX: Event Persistence Error

### The Other Error We Keep Seeing:
```
null value in column "aggregate_id" violates not-null constraint
```

### Root Cause:
The `EventStoreRepository` is passing `NULL` for `aggregate_id` when it should be passing the `gameId`.

### Location:
`src/services/database/event-store.repo.ts` (TypeScript, not our modularized code)

### The Fix (TypeScript):
```typescript
// In event-store.repo.ts
async append(event: DomainEvent): Promise<void> {
  const query = `
    INSERT INTO domain_events (
      aggregate_type, aggregate_id, event_type, event_data, version, user_id, metadata
    ) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7)
  `;
  
  await this.client.query(query, [
    event.aggregateType,
    event.aggregateId, // ‚ùå This is NULL!
    event.eventType,
    event.eventData,
    event.version,
    event.userId,
    event.metadata
  ]);
}
```

**The problem:** `event.aggregateId` is `NULL` because when the event is created, it's not being populated.

**Where it's created:** `dist/core/engine/game-state-machine.js` (compiled TypeScript)

**The issue:** We're passing events like:
```javascript
{
  eventType: 'game.hand_started',
  aggregateType: 'Game',
  aggregateId: gameId, // ‚ùå gameId is undefined or not passed
  ...
}
```

**Quick Fix (Without touching TypeScript):**
Turn off event persistence by setting in `.env`:
```
USE_EVENT_PERSISTENCE=false
```

**Proper Fix (Requires TypeScript recompilation):**
Ensure `gameId` is always passed when creating domain events.

## üìã THE COMPLETE FIX PLAN

### Phase 1: Frontend State Restoration (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. ‚úÖ Update `loadSeats()` to identify user's seat
2. ‚úÖ Update `renderSeatGrid()` to highlight "YOUR SEAT"
3. ‚úÖ Add `renderGameState()` to display current hand
4. ‚úÖ Update `autoJoinRoomById()` to check for active hand
5. ‚úÖ Hide/show "Start Hand" button based on game state

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Fixes 90% of user-reported issues

---

### Phase 2: Event Persistence (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Disable event persistence temporarily (`USE_EVENT_PERSISTENCE=false`)
2. üîÑ Fix `aggregateId` issue in TypeScript (requires recompilation)

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes (temp fix), 1 hour (proper fix)  
**Impact:** Removes error spam from logs

---

### Phase 3: Backend Improvements (LOW PRIORITY)
1. ‚úÖ Already done: Strengthen hand-active detection
2. ‚úÖ Already done: Clear seats properly
3. ‚úÖ Already done: Return 409 for duplicate starts

**Estimated Time:** Already complete  
**Impact:** Prevents backend errors

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Step 1: Disable Event Persistence (2 minutes)
**Why:** Stop the error spam so we can focus on real issues

**How:**
```bash
# Edit .env file
USE_EVENT_PERSISTENCE=false
```

**Restart server**

---

### Step 2: Fix Frontend State Restoration (30 minutes)
**Priority Order:**
1. Update `loadSeats()` - identify user's seat
2. Update `renderSeatGrid()` - highlight "YOUR SEAT"
3. Add game state check in `autoJoinRoomById()`
4. Add `renderGameState()` function
5. Test refresh flow

---

### Step 3: Test and Verify (10 minutes)
**Test Case:**
1. Start game, deal cards
2. Refresh page
3. Verify:
   - ‚úÖ My seat is highlighted as "YOUR SEAT"
   - ‚úÖ Other seats show as "Taken"
   - ‚úÖ Current game state is displayed (cards, pot)
   - ‚úÖ "Start Hand" button is hidden
   - ‚úÖ No errors in console

---

## üöÄ AFTER THIS FIX

### What Will Work:
- ‚úÖ Refresh doesn't break the game
- ‚úÖ Users see their seat highlighted
- ‚úÖ Current game state is preserved
- ‚úÖ No duplicate start attempts
- ‚úÖ Clean console (no event errors)

### What We Can Build Next (Week 4):
- Action buttons (Fold, Check, Bet, Raise)
- Hand history display
- Rebuy system
- Chat system

## üìä ROOT CAUSE SUMMARY

| Problem | Root Cause | Solution |
|---------|------------|----------|
| "Seats show as taken" | Frontend doesn't identify user's seat after refresh | Update `loadSeats()` and `renderSeatGrid()` |
| "Can't interact after refresh" | Game state not restored | Add `renderGameState()` function |
| "Start Game doesn't work" | Trying to start when hand is active | Check hand status before showing button |
| Event persistence errors | `aggregate_id` is NULL | Disable or fix TypeScript event creation |

---

**Status:** üéØ **STRATEGIC PLAN READY**

This is the proper fix. No more band-aids. Let's implement this systematically.
