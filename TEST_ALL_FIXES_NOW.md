## 🔍 WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### **✅ CORRECT BEHAVIOR:**

   - Shows "CALL $X" when someone bet

2. **Hand Strength:**
   - **Preflop:** "Pair of Aces", "High Card - King", etc.
   - **Flop:** Updates to "Two Pair - Aces and Nines"
   - **Turn:** Updates to "Full House - Aces over Nines"
   - **River:** Updates to final hand

3. **Betting Rounds:**
   - **After everyone acts** → Next street deals automatically
   - **No extra calls needed**
   - **Smooth progression**

4. **Showdown:**
   - **No action buttons** (they disappear)
   - **Winner announced immediately**
   - **Correct hand rankings**

---

### **❌ BUG INDICATORS (Should NOT happen):**

- ❌ Button shows "CALL $5" when you already matched the bet
- ❌ Have to press CALL multiple times before flop/turn/river deals
- ❌ Action buttons still visible during showdown
- ❌ Hand strength doesn't update when community cards are revealed
- ❌ Hand ends in a tie when one player clearly has better hand
