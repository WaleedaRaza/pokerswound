# üî• FRESH START - STRIP AND REBUILD

**Date:** Oct 30, 2025  
**Philosophy:** Stop patching. Build clean.

---

## ‚ùå What's Wrong With Current Approach

### The Pattern We Keep Hitting
```
1. Try to use existing endpoint
2. Hit missing DB column error
3. Patch the column out
4. Hit another missing column error
5. Patch again
6. Infinite loop of patches
```

### Why This Fails
- **Existing code has dependencies on DB schema we don't have**
- **Hydration endpoint expects columns that don't exist**
- **Game engine expects data structures that aren't populated**
- **We're fighting the architecture instead of building for our reality**

---

## ‚úÖ What We Should Do

### Phase 1: ANALYZE (30 minutes)

**Strip to absolute bare minimum:**

1. **What DB tables actually exist?**
   - Check `Schemasnapshot.txt`
   - List columns we ACTUALLY have
   - Ignore what "should" be there

2. **What does the UI need?**
   - Display 9 seats
   - Claim a seat
   - Start a hand
   - Show 2 cards
   - That's it. Nothing else.

3. **What's the minimum data flow?**
   ```
   UI clicks seat
     ‚Üì
   POST /claim-seat ‚Üí INSERT INTO room_seats (room_id, user_id, seat_index, chips)
     ‚Üì
   UI clicks start
     ‚Üì
   POST /start-hand ‚Üí Deal 2 cards, store somewhere
     ‚Üì
   GET /my-cards ‚Üí Return just those 2 cards
     ‚Üì
   UI displays cards
   ```

### Phase 2: PLAN (30 minutes)

**Create 3 new endpoints that ONLY use columns we have:**

1. **`POST /api/minimal/claim-seat`**
   - Takes: `{roomId, userId, seatIndex}`
   - Writes: `INSERT INTO room_seats (room_id, user_id, seat_index, chips_in_play) VALUES (...)`
   - Returns: `{success: true}`
   - **No complex joins, no missing columns**

2. **`GET /api/minimal/seats/:roomId`**
   - Takes: `roomId`
   - Queries: `SELECT seat_index, user_id FROM room_seats WHERE room_id = $1`
   - Returns: `{seats: [{index: 0, userId: "..."}, ...]}`
   - **That's it. Nothing fancy.**

3. **`POST /api/minimal/deal-cards`**
   - Takes: `{roomId, userId}`
   - Logic: Generate 2 random cards
   - Stores: In a simple JSON column or in-memory Map
   - Returns: `{cards: ["hearts_A", "clubs_K"]}`
   - **Doesn't touch game_states table if it's broken**

### Phase 3: IMPLEMENT (1 hour)

**Build these 3 endpoints from scratch:**
- New file: `routes/minimal.js`
- No dependencies on existing services
- Only use columns we KNOW exist
- Test each endpoint individually with curl

**Build minimal UI:**
- Use the `minimal-table.html` we have
- But call these new endpoints instead
- Remove all references to hydration, SessionService, etc.

### Phase 4: TEST (15 minutes)

**Prove it works:**
```bash
# 1. Claim seat
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/minimal/claim-seat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"roomId": "test", "userId": "user1", "seatIndex": 0}'

# 2. Get seats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/minimal/seats/test

# 3. Deal cards
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/minimal/deal-cards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"roomId": "test", "userId": "user1"}'
```

If all 3 work, THEN wire to UI.

## üéØ Key Principles

### 1. No Guessing
- Don't assume columns exist
- Check schema first
- Only use what's there

### 2. No Dependencies
- Don't import existing services
- Don't use complex middleware
- Build standalone endpoints

### 3. No Patching
- If something's broken, don't fix it
- Build new instead
- Keep old code isolated

### 4. Prove Each Step
- Test endpoint BEFORE wiring to UI
- Test with curl BEFORE opening browser
- One piece at a time

## üìã Next Steps (You Decide)

### Option A: I Analyze Schema Right Now
- I read `Schemasnapshot.txt`
- I list every column in `rooms`, `room_seats`, `game_states`
- I design 3 minimal endpoints
- I implement them
- **Time: 2 hours total**

### Option B: You Tell Me What You Want
- What tables do we actually have?
- What's the minimal flow you want?
- Should I build a completely separate minimal API?
- **Then I build exactly that**

### Option C: Nuclear Option
- Disable all existing endpoints
- Create brand new `/api/v3/` namespace
- Build poker from scratch
- Only 5 endpoints: create-room, claim-seat, start-game, deal-cards, get-state
- **Clean slate, no legacy baggage**

---

## üî• The Real Problem

**We keep trying to use infrastructure built for a different schema.**

The existing code expects:
- `turn_time_seconds`
- `timebank_seconds`
- `actor_timebank_remaining`
- `processed_actions` table
- Complex game state serialization

**Our DB doesn't have half of this.**

**Solution:** Stop using that code. Build new code for our actual DB.

## üí¨ What I Need From You

**Pick one:**

1. **"Analyze the schema and build 3 minimal endpoints"**
   - I'll read your actual DB schema
   - Build endpoints that ONLY use columns you have
   - Test them with curl
   - Then wire to UI

2. **"Tell me exactly what flow you want"**
   - You describe the user journey
   - I build endpoints to match
   - No assumptions

3. **"Build a separate minimal poker API"**
   - New namespace (`/api/v3/`)
   - 5 endpoints, fully independent
   - Works with your DB as-is

---

**Kill command:** `pkill -f "node sophisticated"`

**Server:** Stopped

**Your move:** Which option? Or tell me your own plan.

I'll build whatever you want, but **no more patching broken shit.** ‚öîÔ∏è
