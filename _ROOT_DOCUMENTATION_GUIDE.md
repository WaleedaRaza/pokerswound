## 🎯 MAINTENANCE RULES

### **Every Session:**
- Update CONTEXT.md with current state
- Archive session-specific docs (if created)
- Update PLAN.md tasks

### **After Major Changes:**
- Update relevant numbered doc (01-06)
- Keep DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md current

### **Never Edit:**
- THE_TEN_COMMANDMENTS.md (unless adding commandment)
- Archived files (history is history)
- Documents in other agent's archives

### **Safe to Edit:**
- CONTEXT.md (designed to change)
- PLAN.md (living document)
- README.md (evolves with project)

---

## 🚨 IF DOCS GET MESSY AGAIN

**Archive anything with these patterns:**
- *_COMPLETE.md (task done)
- *_VICTORY_*.md (session summary)
- *_BATTLE_*.md (planning doc)
- *_STATUS.md (point-in-time snapshot)
- *_CHECKLIST.md (completed checklist)
- SESSION_*.md (except latest)

**Move to:** archive/session-docs/

**Keep only:**
- 00-06 numbered docs
- THE_TEN_COMMANDMENTS.md
- CONTEXT.md
- PLAN.md
- PLATFORM_PROCEDURES.md
- README.md
