# üî• TEST REFRESH SAFETY NOW

## ‚úÖ **WHAT WAS FIXED**

1. ‚úÖ **Hand evaluation** - no more "High Card" splits
2. ‚úÖ **Chip persistence** - chips save to DB after showdown
3. ‚úÖ **Refresh hydration** - refreshing mid-hand restores state

## üß™ **REFRESH TEST (THE BIG ONE)**

### **Step 1: Start a Hand**

2. Claim seats (Seat 0 and Seat 1)

4. **Verify:** Cards dealt, blinds posted, pot shows $15

### **Step 2: Play to FLOP**
1. Player 0 (SB) calls $5
2. Player 1 (BB) checks
3. **Verify:** FLOP shows (3 community cards)
4. **Verify:** Both players see their hole cards
5. **Verify:** Pot shows $20

### **Step 3: REFRESH (CRITICAL TEST)**
1. **HARD REFRESH Player 1's browser** (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **WAIT 2 seconds for page to load**

### **Step 4: Verify State Restored**
‚úÖ **Community cards still visible** (the 3 FLOP cards)  
‚úÖ **Hole cards still visible** (your 2 cards)  
‚úÖ **Pot shows $20** (not $0)  
‚úÖ **Current street shows FLOP** (not PREFLOP)  
‚úÖ **Action buttons visible** (if your turn)  
‚úÖ **"START HAND" button HIDDEN** (game is active)  

### **Step 5: Continue Playing**
1. Player 1 checks (or makes action)
2. **Verify:** Game continues normally
3. **Verify:** TURN card appears
4. Play to showdown

### **Step 6: Verify Correct Winner**
1. At showdown, **verify:** Alert shows CORRECT hand names (not "High Card" for both)
2. **Verify:** Winner gets the pot
3. **Verify:** Chip counts update in seats
4. **Verify:** "NEXT HAND" button appears for host

### **Step 7: Verify Multi-Hand**
1. Host clicks "NEXT HAND"
2. **Verify:** New hand starts with UPDATED chip counts (not reset to $1000)
3. **Verify:** Dealer button moved to next seat
4. **Verify:** Hand number incremented (Hand #2)

## üìä **DEBUG LOGS TO CHECK**

‚úÖ Game state restored successfully
```

**If you see:**

```
**That means:** No active game in DB (either bug, or genuinely no active game)
