 If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound?
 The only constant in life is change. He who knows, knows he knows nothing.

 Less is more.

 To know yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.

 The map is not the territory.

 We see things not as they are, but as we are.

 No man ever steps in the same river twice.

 The eyes are useless when the mind is blind.

 You reap what you sow. If everyone plays optimally, does anyone win?

 If luck is fair, is it still luck?

 When you fold, do your cards miss you?

 Fold your ego, not your hand.

 Maybe the real rake was the friends we made along the way.

 The house always wins, but the mind always wonders.

 We all start as 2-7 offsuit.

 Some days are like slow-playing aces, some days are like bluffing a 2-7.

 Your probability of reading this is 100%.

 We simulated this moment 1,000,000,000,000 times.

 Go all-in on you.

 Everything you’ve ever done has led you here.
 If a chip drops in the lobby and no one’s online, does it make a sound?
