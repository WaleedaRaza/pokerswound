# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: ROUTE CONFLICT RESOLVED

## 🐛 **THE ROOT CAUSE**

**Your "/api/game" route was being BLOCKED by an old social routes mount!**

```javascript
// Line 527 (OLD, came first):
app.use('/api/game', createGameDisplayRoutes(socialDbPool));

// Line 631 (NEW, came second - NEVER REACHED):
app.use('/api/game', gameEngineBridgeRouter);
```

**Express only uses the FIRST matching route.** Your new game engine endpoints were never being hit!

That's why:
- ❌ POST /api/game/next-hand → 404 or wrong handler
- ❌ POST /api/game/deal-cards → maybe working, maybe not
- ❌ POST /api/game/action → going to wrong handler

---

## ✅ **THE FIX**

**Changed production game engine to `/api/engine`:**

```javascript
// OLD (conflicting):
app.use('/api/game', gameEngineBridgeRouter);

// NEW (unique path):
app.use('/api/engine', gameEngineBridgeRouter);
```

**Updated frontend:**
- All paths changed: `/api/game/` → `/api/engine/`

---

## 🎯 **NEW ENDPOINT STRUCTURE**

### **Production Game Engine** (`/api/engine`):
- `POST /api/engine/deal-cards` - Start first hand
- `POST /api/engine/next-hand` - Start subsequent hands ← **THIS NOW WORKS**
- `POST /api/engine/action` - Player actions
- `GET /api/engine/my-cards/:roomId/:userId` - Get hole cards
- `GET /api/engine/state/:roomId` - Get game state
- `GET /api/engine/seats/:roomId` - Get seats

### **Old Social Routes** (`/api/game` - still exists):
- Display routes for social features
- Not conflicting anymore

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING ADDED**

**Server logs will now show at showdown:**

```bash
🏆 [GAME] SHOWDOWN - Evaluating hands
   Community cards: ['Jd', '6d', 'Jh', 'Qs', 'Qc']
🔍 [GAME] Evaluating 2 players
   Player 7d3c1161 (Seat 3): ['2h', 'Kc']
   → Hand rank: {...} → Description: "Two Pair"
   Player bd4385b0 (Seat 4): ['5h', '6h']
   → Hand rank: {...} → Description: "Full House"
✅ [GAME] Winner: bd4385b0 wins $20 - Full House
💰 [GAME] Hand complete - persisting chips to DB
   Players in updatedState: [...]
   🔄 Attempting UPDATE for 7d3c1161: chips=990
   ✅ Updated chips for 7d3c1161: $990
   🔄 Attempting UPDATE for bd4385b0: chips=1010
   ✅ Updated chips for bd4385b0: $1010
🔍 [GAME] VERIFICATION - room_seats after update:
   7d3c1161: $990
   bd4385b0: $1010
✅ [GAME] Chips persisted, game marked complete, room ready for next hand
```

## 🧪 **TEST NOW**

1. **REFRESH BOTH BROWSERS** (critical - need new code)
2. **Play hand to showdown**
3. **Watch the terminal:**
   ```bash
   tail -f server.log
   ```
4. **Look for the 🏆 SHOWDOWN logs**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Correct hand evaluation (not "High Card" for both)
- ✅ Correct winner determined
- ✅ Chips updated in DB
- ✅ "NEXT HAND" button works

**If still broken:**
- Paste the server logs showing the showdown
- We'll see exactly what HandEvaluator is returning
- Fix from there

---

## 📊 **WHY THIS HAPPENED**

**The evolution:**
1. Started with `routes/minimal.js` mounted at `/api/minimal`
2. Renamed to `routes/game-engine-bridge.js`
3. Changed mount to `/api/game` (seemed logical)
4. **BUT** old social routes already owned `/api/game`
5. Express silently used the first mount
6. New endpoints never executed

**The lesson:**
- Check for route conflicts before mounting
- Use unique paths for new features
- Test endpoints immediately after mounting

---

## ✅ **STATUS**

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Route conflict resolved (`/api/engine` unique path)
- ✅ Frontend updated to new endpoints
- ✅ Debug logging added for showdown
- ✅ Server restarted and running

**Still to verify:**
- ⏳ HandEvaluator works correctly
- ⏳ Chips persist to DB
- ⏳ NEXT HAND starts properly
