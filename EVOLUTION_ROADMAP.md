# üöÄ POKER GAME EVOLUTION ROADMAP

## üéØ CURRENT STATE (Where We Are)

### ‚úÖ What Works:
- Room creation/joining with codes
- Seat claiming + WebSocket broadcasting
- Card dealing (2 hole cards per player)
- Betting actions (FOLD/CHECK/CALL/RAISE)
- Street progression (PREFLOP ‚Üí FLOP ‚Üí TURN ‚Üí RIVER)
- Showdown evaluation (HandEvaluator)
- Winner determination
- Basic chip updates

### ‚ùå What's Broken:
- **Chip persistence doesn't work** (players still have $1000 after hand)
- **NEXT HAND just deals cards** (doesn't rotate dealer, reset properly)
- **No post-showdown period** (instant next hand)
- **No show/muck cards option**
- **Game doesn't end** (no elimination/last man standing)
- **Dealer doesn't rotate**
- **Blinds don't rotate**

---

## üìã PHASE 1: FIX CORE HAND COMPLETION (CRITICAL)

### **GOAL:** Make one hand complete properly with correct chip awards

#### **TODO 1.1: Debug Chip Persistence** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Problem:** Chips update in gameState but not in reality
**Steps:**
1. Add console.log before/after room_seats UPDATE
2. Query room_seats after update to verify
3. Check if deal-cards reads from room_seats correctly
4. Verify UPDATE query isn't failing silently

**Expected Result:** After hand ends, query room_seats shows updated chips

#### **TODO 1.2: Fix Deal-Cards to Read Persisted Chips** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Problem:** New hand probably starts with hardcoded $1000
**Steps:**
1. Check `/api/minimal/deal-cards` endpoint
2. Ensure it reads `chips_in_play` from `room_seats` table
3. Use those chips as starting stack for new hand
4. Don't hardcode any chip values

**Expected Result:** Hand 2 starts with Hand 1's ending chips

#### **TODO 1.3: Add Post-Showdown Period** üü° HIGH
**Problem:** No delay between showdown and next hand
**Steps:**
1. After handleShowdown(), set `gameState.phase = 'POST_SHOWDOWN'`
2. Frontend detects this phase ‚Üí shows 5-second countdown
3. During countdown:
   - Show final board
   - Show winner(s) with hand description
   - Show chip changes (+/- for each player)
   - Option to "SHOW CARDS" or "MUCK" (if folded earlier)
4. After 5 seconds, game enters 'COMPLETE' phase
5. Host can click "NEXT HAND"

**Expected Result:** 
- Winner announced with 5-second display
- Chips visibly awarded
- Players can show/muck
- Clean transition to next hand

#### **TODO 1.4: Implement Dealer Rotation** üü° HIGH
**Problem:** Dealer button doesn't move
**Steps:**
1. Track `dealer_position` in `rooms` table or `game_states`
2. On "NEXT HAND" click:
   - `dealer_position = (dealer_position + 1) % playerCount`
   - Recalculate SB, BB positions
   - Save to DB
3. Frontend displays dealer button chip on correct seat

**Expected Result:** Dealer button rotates clockwise each hand

#### **TODO 1.5: Implement Blind Rotation** üü° HIGH
**Problem:** Same players always post blinds
**Steps:**
1. Calculate SB/BB based on dealer position
2. 2-player: Dealer=SB, other=BB
3. 3+ players: Dealer ‚Üí SB (next) ‚Üí BB (next+1)
4. First actor post-flop = first after dealer
5. Blinds auto-deducted on deal

**Expected Result:** Blinds rotate with dealer, correct player acts first

4. Player can spectate but not act
5. Don't deal cards to eliminated players

**Expected Result:** Player with $0 is eliminated, can't play

#### **TODO 2.3: Detect Game End (Last Man Standing)** üü° HIGH
**Problem:** Game never ends
**Steps:**
1. After each hand, count active players
2. If `activeCount === 1`:

   - Show "üèÜ Player X WINS!" alert
   - Display final standings (1st, 2nd, 3rd...)
   - Option to "START NEW GAME" (resets all chips)

**Expected Result:** Game ends when 1 player remains, shows winner

#### **TODO 2.4: Implement Sit Out / Return** üü¢ MEDIUM
**Steps:**
1. Add "SIT OUT NEXT HAND" button
2. Sets `room_seats.status = 'SITTING_OUT'`
