## 🐛 Bugs Found & Fixed (7 Critical Issues)

### Issue 1: Server Won't Start (Syntax Error)
**Error:** `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '*'`  
**Cause:** Leftover `/* */` comment syntax from code deletion  
**Fix:** Changed to `//` comments  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

### Issue 2: Auth Sync Email Column
**Error:** `column "email" does not exist`  
**Cause:** `user_profiles` table doesn't have `email` column  
**Fix:** Removed email references from queries  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

### Issue 3: Lobby Join Schema Mismatch
**Error:** `column "user_id" does not exist`  
**Cause:** `user_profiles` uses `id` as primary key, not `user_id`  
**Fix:** Changed all queries to use `id` instead of `user_id`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

### Issue 4: Missing Socket.IO Broadcasts
**Problem:** Host doesn't see guest join lobby in real-time  
**Cause:** No Socket.IO `emit()` calls after database updates  
**Fix:** Added broadcasts for `player_joined`, `player_approved`, `player_rejected`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

### Issue 5: Seat Broadcast Parameter Mismatch
**Error:** `Seat broadcast failed: getDb is not a function`  
**Cause:** `broadcastSeats(roomId)` called with 1 param instead of 3  
**Fix:** Changed to `broadcastSeats(io, getDb, roomId)`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

### Issue 6: Game Start Failures
**Errors:**
- `column "state" does not exist`
- `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'processAction')`

**Causes:**
1. Schema mismatch: querying `state` instead of `current_state`
2. `stateMachine` was `null` when routes tried to use it

**Fixes:**
1. Updated query to select `current_state, status`
2. Updated `app.locals.stateMachine` after initialization

**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

### Issue 7: Refresh Breaks Game
**Problem:** After refresh, seats show as "taken" and "Start Game" does nothing  
**Errors:**
- `Seat already occupied`
- Multiple duplicate "Start Hand" attempts

**Cause:** Frontend re-attempts game start on refresh, backend tries to re-add players to already-occupied seats

**Fixes:**
1. Check if hand is already active before re-bridging
2. Clear `table.seats` in addition to `players` when re-bridging

**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 1. **Event Persistence Errors**
```
null value in column "aggregate_id" violates not-null constraint
```
**Impact:** Low - Game still works, events just don't persist  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Fix:** Schema alignment for `domain_events` table

### 2. **Duplicate Key Violations**
```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "game_states_pkey"
```
**Impact:** Low - In-memory game works fine  
**Priority:** Low  
**Fix:** Better game ID management

### 3. **Missing Table Columns**
```
column "current_game_id" of relation "rooms" does not exist
```
**Impact:** Low - Room-game linking fails but game still playable  
**Priority:** Low  
**Fix:** Add column to schema or remove linking attempt
