### **API Endpoints Used:**

#### Zoom-Lock:
- `GET /api/rooms/:roomId/hydrate` (basic hydration)
- `POST /api/rooms/:roomId/join` (seat claiming)
- `POST /api/games` (game creation)
- `POST /api/games/:gameId/start-hand`
- `POST /api/games/:gameId/actions`
- `POST /api/rooms/:roomId/kick`
- `POST /api/rooms/:roomId/update-chips`

#### Sandbox:
- `GET /api/engine/game/:roomId` (full game state)
- `POST /api/engine/start-hand`
- `POST /api/engine/action` (with show/muck support)
- `POST /api/engine/showdown-action`
- `POST /api/engine/host-controls/kick-player`
- `POST /api/engine/host-controls/update-blinds`

**❗ CRITICAL ISSUE:** Different API endpoints = can't just swap files!

## 🎯 MIGRATION STRATEGY

### **Option A: Adapt Zoom-Lock to Use Sandbox Backend** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Pros:**
- Keep the beautiful UI
- Integrate working game logic
- Less code changes overall

**Cons:**
- Need to update ALL API calls in zoom-lock
- Need to port show/muck, dealer rotation, etc.

**Steps:**
1. Copy zoom-lock HTML structure to new file
2. Replace API calls to use `/api/engine/*`
3. Port sandbox JS event handlers
4. Port show/muck, winner banner, position badges
5. Test each feature incrementally

---

### **Option B: Add Zoom-Lock to Sandbox** ⚠️ MORE RISKY
**Pros:**
- Game logic stays intact
- No API changes needed

**Cons:**
- Harder to integrate zoom-lock CSS
- More prone to breaking existing features
- CSS conflicts likely

**Steps:**
1. Copy zoom-lock CSS to sandbox
2. Replace 3x3 grid with zoom-lock container
3. Update seat rendering to use circular positions
4. Test extensively

## 🎬 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP

**Create `minimal-table-zoom.html`** by:
1. Copying `poker-table-zoom-lock.html`
2. Updating API calls to `/api/engine/*`
3. Keeping ALL zoom-lock UI intact
4. Wiring to sandbox backend

**Files to Reference:**
- `public/minimal-table.html` (for game logic)
- `public/poker-table-zoom-lock.html` (for UI)

### DO:
✅ Copy zoom-lock UI wholesale
